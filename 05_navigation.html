  <p>
  <p>get() and history navigation. The discussion of "get" will
  need to be pretty precise about when the method returns,
  including the common case of switching to "about:blank" when
  opening a new tab.</p>

  <p>This section will also need to deal with handling self-signed
  SSL certificates.</p>

  <p>WebDriver implementations MUST support navigating between
  domains.</p>

    <h3>Detecting When to Proceed</h3>

    <p>This entire section is non-normative for now, and should be considered a
    placeholder for future discussion.</p>

    <p>Upon receiving a Command, the remote end SHOULD not execute that Command
    until the current frame has "loaded". This can be detected in a number of
    ways:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Conservative</dt>
      <dd>The remote end waits until all frames and iframes in the window
      containing an HTML document are at "document.readyState == 'complete'" and
      there are no outstanding HTTP requests, other than those caused by an
      XMLHTTPRequest. If a frame does not contain an HTML document, the remote
      end waits until all HTTP traffic to that frame is complete.</dd>

      <dt>Normal</dt>
      <dd>The remote ends waits until the current frame reaches
      "document.readyState == 'complete'" or there are no more outstanding
      network requests.</dd>

      <dt>Eager</dt>
      <dd>The remote end waits until the currrent frame reaches
      "document.readyState == 'interactive' || document.readyState ==
      'complete'" or there are no more outstanding network requests.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Unless the user specificies otherwise, the "Normal" page load detection
    mechanism must be used.</p>
