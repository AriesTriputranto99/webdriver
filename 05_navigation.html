<h2>Navigation</h2>
  
<p>Almost all usages of the WebDriver API begin by navigating to a particular URL. This section not only describes the commands used for navigation, but also describes when commands must be processed.</p>

<p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support navigating between different HTTP domains and between HTTPS and HTTP domains if the underlying browser supports this.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="page-load-strategies">Page Load Strategies</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>conservative</dt>
  <dd>The remote end MUST wait until all frames and iframes in the window currently be used to process commands
  that contain an HTML document are at "<a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/single-page.html#current-document-readiness">document.readyState</a> == 'complete'" and
  there are no outstanding HTTP requests, other than those caused by
  XMLHttpRequests. If a frame or iframe does not contain an HTML document, the remote
  end SHOULD wait until all HTTP traffic to that frame is complete.</dd>

  <dt>normal</dt>
  <dd>The remote end MUST wait until the frame currently handling commands reaches
  "document.readyState == 'complete'" or there are no more outstanding
  network requests other than XMLHttpRequests.</dd>

  <dt>eager</dt>
  <dd>The remote end MUST wait until the frame currently handling commands reaches
  "document.readyState == 'interactive' || document.readyState ==
  'complete'" or there are no more outstanding network requests.</dd>
  
  <dt>none</dt>
  <dd>The remote end does not do any checks to see if a page load is currently active.</dd>
</dl>

<p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support the <code>normal</code> and <code>eager</code> modes and SHOULD support the <code>conservative</code> and <code>none</code> modes. If no page loading strategy is chosen, then <code>normal</code> MUST be the default.
In addition, implementors MAY add additional page loading strategies.</p>

<h2>Navigation Commands</h2>

<table class="simple">
	<tr>
		<td>Command Name</td>
		<td>get</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Parameters</td>
		<td>"url" {string} The URL to be navigated to.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>Return Value</td>
	    <td>None</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>Errors</td>
	    <td>TimedOutException if the page load takes too long <a href="#timeouts">as specified by the timeouts</a>.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The "get" command is used to cause the browser to navigate to a new location, and is named after the HTTP verb. From a user's point of view, this is as if they have entered the "url" into the URL bar. When the command returns is based on the <a href="#page-load-strategies">page load strategy</a> that the user has selected with the following exceptions when the strategy is not "none":

<ul>
    <li>HTTP redirects MUST be automatically followed without responding to the command.</li>
    <li>When a page contains a META tag with the "http-equiv" attribute set to "refresh", a response MUST be returned if the timeout is greater than 1 second and the other criteria for determining whether a page is loaded are met.</li>
    <li>If any modal dialog box, such as those opened by on <code>window.onbeforeunload</code> or <code>window.alert</code>, is opened at any point in the page load, a response MUST be sent.</li>
    <li>If a 401 response is seen by the browser, a response MUST be sent. That is, if BASIC, DIGEST, NTLM or similar authentication is required, the page load is assumed to be complete. This does not include FORM-based authentication.</li>
</ul>    

<section>
<h2>Invalid SSL Certificates</h2>

<table class="simple">
  <tr><td>Capability Name</td><td>Type</td></tr>
  <tr><td>secureSsl</td><td>boolean</td></tr>
</table>


<p>WebDriver implementations MUST support users accessing sites served via HTTPS. Access to those sites using self-signed or invalid certificates, and where the certificate does not match the serving domain MUST be the same as if the HTTPS was configured properly.</p>

<p class="note">The reason for this is that implementations of this spec are often used for testing. It's a sorry fact that many QA engineers and testers are asked to verify that apps work on sites that have insecure HTTPS configurations</p>
</section>

<p>The exception to requirement is if the <code>Capabilities</code> used to initialize has the WebDriver session had the capability <code>secureSsl</code> set to true. In this case, implementations MAY choose to make accessing a site with bad HTTPS configurations cause a <code>WebDriverException</code> to be thrown. Remote end implementations MUST return a <code>UnkownError</code> status in this case. <strong>TODO: specify a proper error code for this?</strong> If this is the case, the <code>Capabilities</code> describing the session MUST also set the <code>secureSsl</code> capability to "true".

<h3>Detecting When to Handle Commands</h3>

<p>Commands MUST only be processed when the <span id="page-loading-strategies">page loading strategy</span> being used indicates that page loading is complete.</p>

<p>If a remote end receives a new <code>Command</code> for a session while still waiting to finish an existing <code>Command</code> for that session it MAY choose to queue the command for execution as soon as possible, it MAY throw a <code>WebDriverException</code> or it may leave the remote end in an inconsistent state. Because of this, local ends SHOULD NOT attempt to send a new <code>Command</code> to a session until the previous <code>Command</code> has returned.</p>
