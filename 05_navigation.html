<h2>Navigation</h2>
  
<p>Almost all usages of the WebDriver API begin by navigating to a particular URL. This section not only describes the commands used for navigation, but also describes when commands must be processed.</p>

<p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support navigating between different HTTP domains and between HTTPS and HTTP domains if the underlying browser supports this.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="page-load-strategies">Page Load Strategies</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>conservative</dt>
  <dd>The remote end MUST wait until all frames and iframes in the window currently be used to process commands
  that contain an HTML document are at "<a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/single-page.html#current-document-readiness">document.readyState</a> == 'complete'" and
  there are no outstanding HTTP requests, other than those caused by
  XMLHttpRequests. If a frame or iframe does not contain an HTML document, the remote
  end SHOULD wait until all HTTP traffic to that frame is complete.</dd>

  <dt>normal</dt>
  <dd>The remote ends MUST wait until the frame currently handling commands reaches
  "document.readyState == 'complete'" or there are no more outstanding
  network requests other than XMLHttpRequests.</dd>

  <dt>eager</dt>
  <dd>The remote end MUST wait until the frame currently handling commands reaches
  "document.readyState == 'interactive' || document.readyState ==
  'complete'" or there are no more outstanding network requests.</dd>
  
  <dt>none</dt>
  <dd>The remote end does not do any checks to see if a page load is currently active.</dd>
</dl>

<p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support the <code>normal</code> and <code>eager</code> modes and SHOULD support the <code>conservative</code> and <code>none</code> modes. If no page loading strategy is chosen, then <code>normal</code> MUST be the default.
In addition, implementors MAY add additional page loading strategies.</p>

<h2>Navigation Commands</h2>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Command Name</td>
		<td>get</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Parameters</td>
		<td>"url" {string} The URL to be navigated to.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>Return Value</td>
	    <td>None</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>Errors</td>
	    <td>TimedOutException if the page load takes too long <a href="#timeouts">as specified by the timeouts</a>.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The "get" command is used to cause the browser under test to navigate to a new location, and is named after the HTTP verb. From a user's point of view, this is as if they have entered the "url" into the URL bar. When the command returns is based on the <a href="#page-load-strategies">page load strategy</a> that the user has selected with the following exceptions when the strategy is not "none":

<ul>
    <li>HTTP redirects MUST be automatically followed without first returning control to the user.</li>
    <li>Control MUST return to the user on pages with an HTML META tags that would cause a refresh only if the timeout is greater than 1 second.</li>
    <li>Control MUST be returned to the user if any modal dialog box, such as those opened by on <code>window.onbeforeunload</code> or <code>window.alert</code>, is opened at any point.</li>
    <li>Control MUST be returned to the user if user credentials are requested by the browser. That is, if BASIC, DIGEST, NTLM or similar authentication is required. This does not include FORM-based authentication.</li>
</ul>    

<section>
<h2>Invalid SSL Certificates</h2>

<table>
  <tr><td>Capability Name</td><td>Type</td></tr>
  <tr><td>secureSsl</td><td>boolean</td></tr>
</table>


<p>WebDriver implementations MUST support users accessing sites served via HTTPS. Access to those sites using self-signed or invalid certificates, and where the certificate does not match the serving domain MUST be the same as if the HTTPS was configured properly.</p>

<p class="note">The reason for this is that WebDriver instances are often used for testing. It's a sorry fact that many QA and testers are asked to verify that apps work on sites that have insecure HTTPS configurations</p>
</section>

<p>The exception to requirement is if the <code>Capabilities</code> used to initialize has the WebDriver session had the capability <code>secureSsl</code> set to true. In this case, implementations MAY chose to make accessing a site with bad HTTPS configurations cause a <code>WebDriverException</code> to be thrown. If this is the case, the <code>Capabilities</code> describing the session MUST also set the <code>secureSsl</code> capability to "true".

<h3>Detecting When to Handle Commands</h3>

<p>WebDriver instances MUST only process commands when the <span id="page-loading-strategies">page loading strategy</span> being used indicates that control would be returned to the user.</p>
