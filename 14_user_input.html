  <h2>User Input</h2>
    <p>There are two ways to interact with a elements: Directly or indirectly.
    Direct interaction with elements is sending interaction commands directly to
    an element. In this kind of interaction, the implementation of this
    specification should take additional steps to ensure the interaction could
    happen as the user intended. Indirect interaction is more versatile by not
    tying a user-interaction to an element. Instead, these interactions are
    based on mouse position and the currently active element.</p>

    <h2>Clicking</h2>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface WebElement">
      <dt>void click()</dt>
      <dd>Clicks in the middle of the <code>WebElement</code> instance. The
      middle of the element is defined as the middle of the box returned by
      calling <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view/#the-getclientrects-and-getboundingclientrect-methods">getBoundingClientRect</a> on the underlying DOM Element, according to the [[!CSSOM-VIEW]] spec. If the element is outside the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#viewport">viewport</a> (according to the [[!CSS2]] spec), the implementation should bring the element into view first. The implementation MAY invoke scrollIntoView on the underlying DOM Element.</dd>
