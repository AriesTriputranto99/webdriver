  <h2>User Input</h2>
    <p>There are two ways to interact with elements: directly or implicitly. The
    difference between the two is similar to the difference between "Do what I
    mean" vs "Do as I say":  The commands for directly interacting with elements
    express explicit intention for the desired outcome. For this kind of
    interaction, the implementation of this specification should take
    additional steps to ensure the interaction would happen as the user
    intended (for example, by scrolling the element into the viewport).
    Implicit interaction differs by following the user's instructions without
    additional interpretation. Interaction would be with the currently active element, as defined by the browser. The implementation would maintain the current keyboard and mouse state in order to fulfill the user's instructions.</p>
    <section>
    <h2>Interaction directly with elements</h2>
    <section>
    <h2>Interactable elements</h2>
    <p>Some user-input actions required the element to be interactable. The following conditions must be met for the element to be considered interactable:
    <ul>
      <li>The element MUST be visible, as defined in section 10.1.</li>
      <li>The element MUST NOT be disabled:
      <ul>
        <li>If the currently loaded document is HTML4, the element does not support the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#adef-disabled">disabled</a> attribute (according to the [[!HTML401]] spec), or the disabled attribute is not set.</li>
        <li>If the currently loaded document is HTML5, the element is not <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#adef-disabled">disabled</a> as defined in the [[!HTML5]] spec.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Clicking</h2>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface WebElement">
      <dt>void click()</dt>
      <dd>Clicks in the middle of the <code>WebElement</code> instance. The middle of the element is defined as the middle of the box returned by
      calling <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view/#the-getclientrects-and-getboundingclientrect-methods">getBoundingClientRect</a> on the underlying DOM Element, according to the [[!CSSOM-VIEW]] spec. If the element is outside the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#viewport">viewport</a> (according to the [[!CSS21]] spec), the implementation should bring the element into view first. The implementation MAY invoke scrollIntoView on the underlying DOM Element. The element MUST be visible, as defined in section 10.1. See the note below for when the element is obscured by another element.
      Exceptions:
      <ul>
        <li>links (A elements): Clicking happens in the middle of the first bounding client rectangle. This is to overcome overflowing links where the middle of the bounding client rectangle does not actually fall on a clickable part of the link.</li>
        <li>Select elements with without the multiple attribute set: Clicking on the select element MUST open up a selection menu. After clicking on an option, the selection menu MUST be closed. Clicking directly on an option element (without clicking on the select element previously) MUST open a selection menu, as if the select option was clicked first. Ultimately, after clicking clicking one of the options, the selection menu MUST be closed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The possible errors for this command:
      <ul>
        <li>StaleElementReference if the given element is no longer attached to the DOM.</li>
        <li>ElementNotVisible if the element is hidden and thus cannot be interacted with.</li>
        <li>MoveTargetOutOfBounds if the element cannot be scrolled into view.</li>
      </ul>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p class="note">As the goal is to emulate users as closely as possible, the implementation SHOULD NOT allow clicking on elements that are obscured by other elements. The implementation SHOULD try to scroll the element into view, but in case it is fully obscured, it should not be clickable.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Typing keys</h2>
    <p>A pre-requirement for keys-based interaction with an element is that it is interactable (as defined earlier in the section). Typing into an element could take place if one of the following conditions is met:
    <ul>
      <li>The element is <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#focus">focusable</a> as defined in the editing section of the [[!HTML5]] spec.</li>
      <li>The element could be the <code>activeElement</code>. In addition to focusable elements, this allows typing to the <code>body</code> element.</li>
      <li>In an HTML5 document, the element is <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#attr-contenteditable">editable</a> as a result of having its <code>contentEditable</code> attribute set or the containing document is in <code>designMode</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Prior to any keyboard interaction, the element SHOULD be focused if it
    does not currently have the focus. This is the case if one of the following
    holds:
    <ul>
      <li>The element is not <code>document.activeElement</code></li>
      <li>The owner document of the element to be interacted with is not the
      focused document.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In case focusing is needed, the implementation MUST follow the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#focus-management"><b>focusing steps</b></a> as described in the focus management section of the [[!HTML5]] spec. The focus MUST NOT leave the element at the end of the interaction, other than as a result of the interaction itself (i.e. when the tab key is sent).
    </p>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface WebElement">
      <dt>void clear()</dt>
      <dd>Clears the value of the element.</dd>
      <dt>void sendKeys(string[] keysToSend)</dt>
      <dd>Sends a sequence of keyboard events representing the keys in the keysToSend parameter.
      <p>Caret positioning: If focusing was needed, after following the focusing steps, the caret MUST be positioned at the end of the text currently in the element. At the end of the interaction, the caret MUST be positioned at the end of the typed text sequence, unless the keys sent position it otherwise (e.g. using the LEFT key).</p>
      <p>There are four different types of keys that are emulated:
      <ul>
        <li>Character literals - lower-case symbols.</li>
        <li>Uppercase letters and symbols requiring the SHIFT key for typing.</li>
        <li>Modifier keys</li>
        <li>Special keys</li>
      </ul>The rest of this section details the values used to represent the different keys, as well as the expected behaviour for each key type.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>When emulating user input, the implementation MUST generate
    the same sequence of events that would have been produced if a real user was
    sitting in front of the keyboard and typing the sequence of characters. In
    cases where there is more than one way to type this sequence, the
    implementation MUST choose one of the valid ways. For example, typing <code>AB</code> may be achieved by:
    <ul>
      <li>Holding down the Shift key</li>
      <li>Pressing the letter 'a'</li>
      <li>Pressing the letter 'b'</li>
      <li>Releasing the Shift key</li>
    </ul>
    Alternatively, it can be achieved by:
    <ul>
      <li>Holding down the Shift key</li>
      <li>Pressing the letter 'a'</li>
      <li>Releasing the Shift key</li>
      <li>Holding down the Shift key</li>
      <li>Pressing the letter 'b'</li>
      <li>Releasing the Shift key</li>
    </ul>
    Or by simply turning on the CAPS LOCK first. Since all methods are valid, any of them can be used.
    <p>
    The implementation MAY use the following algorithm to generate the events.
    If the implementation is using a different algorithm, it MUST adhere to the
    requirements listed below.
    <p>For each key, <code>key</code> in <code>keysToSend</code>, do
    <ol>
      <li>If <code>key</code> is a lower-case symbol:
      <ol>
        <li>If the Shift key is not pressed:
        <ol>
          <li>Generate a sequence of key-down, key-press and key-up events with <code>key</code> as
          the character to emulate</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>else (The Shift key is pressed)
        <ol>
          <li>let <code>uppercaseKey</code> be the upper-case character matching <code>key</code></li>
          <li>Generate a sequence of key-down, key-press and key-up events with <code>uppercaseKey</code> as the character to emulate</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Else if <code>key</code> is an upper-case symbol:
      <ol>
        <li>If the Shift key is not pressed:
        <ol>
          <li>Generate a key-down event of the Shift key.
          <li>Generate a sequence of key-down, key-press and key-up events with <code>key</code> as
          the character to emulate</li>
          <li>Generate a key-up event of the Shift key.
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>else (The Shift key is pressed)
        <ol>
          <li>Generate a sequence of key-down, key-press and key-up events with <code>key</code> as the character to emulate</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Else if <code>key</code> represents a modifier key:
      <ol>
        <li>let <code>modifier</code> be the modifier key represented by
        <code>key</code></li>
        <li>If <code>modifier</code> is currently held down:
        <ol><li>Generate a key-up event of <code>modifier</code></li></ol>
        </li>
        <li>Else:
        <ol><li>Generate a key-down event of <code>modifier</code></li></ol>
        </li>
        <li>Maintain this key state and use it to modify the input until it is
        pressed again.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Else if <code>key</code> represents the NULL key:
      <ol>
        <li>Generate key-up events of all modifier keys currently held
        down.</li>
        <li>All modifier keys are now assumed to be released.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Else if <code>key</code> represents a special key:
      <ol>
        <li>Translate <code>key</code> to the special key it represents</li>
        <li>Generate a sequence of key-down, key-press and key-up events for the special key.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once keyboard input is complete, an implicit NULL key is sent unless the
    final character is the NULL key.</p>
    <p> <!-- Pseudo-code --></p>
    <p>Any implementation MUST comply with these requirements:
    <ul>
      <li>For uppercase letters and symbols that require the Shift key to be
      pressed, there are two options:
      <ul>
        <li>A single Shift key-down event is generated before the entire
        sequence of uppercase letters.</li>
        <li>Before each such letter or symbol, a Shift key-down event is
        generated. After each letter or symbol, a Shift key-up event is
        generated.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>A user-specified Shift press implies capitalization of all following
      characters.</li>
      <li>If a user-specified Shift press precedes uppercase letters and
      symbols, a second Shift key-down event MUST NOT be generated. In that
      case, a Shift key-up event MUST NOT be generated implicitly by the
      implementation.</li>
      <li>The NULL key releases all currently held down modifier keys.</li>
      <li>The state of all modifier keys must be reset at the end of each
      <code>sendKeys</code> call and the appropriate key-up events
      generated</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <!-- Algorithm paragraph --></p>
    <h3>Character types</h3>
    <p>The <code>keysToSend</code> parameter contains a mix of printable
    characters and pressable keys that aren't text. Press-able keys that aren't
    text are stored in the Unicode PUA (Private Use Area) code points,
    0xE000-0xF8FF. The following table describes the mapping between PUA and
    key:

    <p>The keys considered upper-case symbols are either defined by the current keyboard locale or are derived from the US 104 keys Windows keyboard layout, which are:
    <ul>
      <li>A - Z</li>
      <li>!$^*()+{}:?|~@#%_\" &amp; &lt; &gt;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When the user input is emulated natively (see note below), the implementation SHOULD use the current keyboard locale to determine which symbols are upper case. In all other cases, the implementation MUST use the US 104 key Windows keyboard layout to determine those symbols.</p>
    <p>The state of the physical keyboard MUST NOT affect emulated user input.</p>
    </p>
    <h3>Internationalized input</h3>
    <p>Non-latin symbols: TBD</p>
    <p>Complex scripts using Input Method Editor (IME): TBD</p>
    </section>
    </section>

    <p class="note">User input should be emulated natively: The input events should be indistinguishable from a user, behind a screen and a keyboard, interacting with the browser. For that purpose, it is highly recommended that input events not be generated at the DOM level. Instead, emulated input events should originate from the browser's own event queue, just like other user input. This is the order of preference for methods to emulate user input:
    <ul>
      <li>Injection into the browser's event queue.</li>
      <li>Sending OS-specific input messages to the browser's window. This has the disadvantage of being OS-specific.</li>
      <li>Use of Javascript to inject events at the DOM level.</li>
      <li>Use of the accessibility API. The disadvantage of this method, in addition to being OS-specific, is that the browser's window must be focused. As a result, multiple tests cannot run in parallel on the same desktop session.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="note">These input methods could be used to interact with whe browser's chrome. However, the way to do so is not defined as it most likely to be implementation-specific.</p>
