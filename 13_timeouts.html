    <ul>
      <li>implicit - Set the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for elements. When searching for a single element, the driver should poll the page until an element is found or the timeout expires, whichever occurs first. When searching for multiple elements, the driver should poll the page until at least one element is found or the timeout expires, at which point it should return an empty list.</br>
      If this command is never sent, the driver should default to an implicit wait of 0ms.</li>
      <li>page load -<strong>TODO(David, Simon)  fill me in</strong> </li>
      <li>script - Set the amount of time the driver should wait when scripts are loading on to the page. </li>
