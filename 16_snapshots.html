  <h2>Screenshots</h2>
  <p>Screenshots are a powerful mechanism for providing information to users of WebDriver, particularly once a particular WebDriver instance has been disposed of. In different circumstances, users want different types of screenshot. Note that the WebDriver spec does not provide a mechanism for taking a screenshot of the entire screen.</p>

  <p>In all cases, screenshots MUST be returned as lossless PNG images encoded using Base64. Local ends MUST provide the user with access to the PNG images without requiring the user to decode the Base64. This access MUST be via at least one of a binary blob or a file.</p>

  <p>All commands within this section are implemented using the "TakesScreenshot" interface:</p>

  <dl class="idl" title="interface TakesScreenshot">
    <dt>DOMString takeScreenshot()</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        <table class="simple jsoncommand">
          <tr>
            <th>HTTP Method</th>
            <th>Path Template</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>GET</td>
            <td id='get-screenshot'>/session/{sessionId}/screenshot</td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      <p>
      Take a screenshot and return a lossless PNG encoded using Base64. If
      <code>element</code> is not populated or is <code>null</code> then the User Agent MUST return the screenshot of the current state of the document at the top level browsing context.
      <p>The possible errors for this command:
      <ul>
        <li><code><a href="#unknown-error">unknown error</a></code> if the if the screenshot cannot be taken.</li>
      </ul>
      <dl class='parameters'>
        <dt>optional WebElement? element</dt>
        <dd>The <a>WebElement</a> on which to operate. If <code>element</code> is not populated or is <code>null</code>
          then the User Agent MUST return the screenshot of the current state of the document at the top level browsing context.</dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
  </dl>

    <h2>Current Top Level Browsing Context</h2>
    <table class="simple">
      <tr><th>Capability Name</th><th>Type</th></tr>
      <tr><td><span id="capability-takesScreenshot">takesScreenshot</span></td><td>boolean</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>If this capability is supported, local end MUST add the <code>TakesScreenshot</code> interface to the <code>WebDriver</code> interface.</p>

    <p>This command will take a screenshot of the return the screenshot of the current state of the document at the top level browsing context. Implementations of the remote end SHOULD capture the entire document, even if this would require a user to scroll the browser window. That is, the returned PNG SHOULD have the same width and height as returned by a call to <code>getSize</code> of the BODY element and MUST contain all visible content on the page, and this SHOULD be done without resizing the browser window. If the remote end is unable to capture the entire Document, then the part of the Document currently displayed in UI of the browser MUST be captured without additional chrome such as scrollbars and browser chrome.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>One way to think of capturing the entire Document is that the user has an infinitely large monitor and has resized the window to allow all content to be visible. One of those monitors would be very cool.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Nested frames MUST be sized as if the user has resized the window to the dimensions of the PNG being returned. This often means that not all potentially visible content within the nested frames is captured.</p>

    <p>Remote ends MUST NOT attempt to track changes in window size as the screenshot is being taken. In particular this means that in the case of a page that makes use of "infinite scrolling" (where an AJAX call is used to populate additional content as the user scrolls down) or in some other way resizes content as the window size is changed only the content that was originally contained in the Document when the command is executed will be captured.</p>

    <h2>Element</h2>
      <table class="simple">
        <tr><th>Capability Name</th><th>Type</th></tr>
        <tr><td><span id="capability-takesElementScreenshot">takesElementScreenshot</span></td><td>boolean</td></tr>
      </table>

  	<p>If this capability is supported, local end MUST add the <code>TakesScreenshot</code> interface to the <code>WebElement</code> interface.</p>
    <p>Remote ends SHOULD take a screenshot of the area bounded by the clientBoundingRect of the Document element represented by the <code>WebElement</code>, returning it as a Base64 encoded, lossless PNG. Local ends MUST make the PNG available directly to the user as at least one of a binary blob or a file. If the remote end cannot capture the entire clientBoundingRect, they MUST scroll as much of the element into the current browser viewport as possible and capture the maximum visible area without additional browser chrome.</p>
    <p>If the <code>WebElement</code> represents a FRAME or IFRAME element, this is equivalent of taking a screenshot of the frame's BODY element.</p>
