  <h2>Security and Privacy</h2>
  <p>The following section is non-normative.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Privacy</h3>
    <p>The local end SHOULD create a new profile when creating a new session.
      If a new profile can be created it MUST NOT copy the profile in use and
      MUST create a fresh profile. By creating a new profile the user agent will
       prevent any unexpected behaviour when the remote end is accessing content.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>The remote end SHOULD have a specific command line argument when starting
      the browser up if it is connecting to a browser
      (e.g. firefox.exe --webdriver ) and SHOULD have user agent configuration
       preference that is tested when the user agent starts up
    <p>When the local end creates a new session the remote end SHOULD limit
    connections to <code>127.0.0.1</code> IPV4 address or <code>::1</code>
    IPV6 address. This will prevent new sessions being created without having
    a specific proxy installed on the remote end.</p>
    <div class='note'>
      <p>Some devices will require the device to be placed into a 'developer' mode.
      This allows unix sockets to be forwarded on to the device while the device is
      connected to a host. An example of this is if the local end needed to go through
       a remote debugger protocol.</p>
    </div>
    <p>If any of these fail then a
    <code><a href="#status-session-not-created">session not created</a></code>
    error MUST be thrown when the local end tries to create a new session.
  </section>

    <h3>Fingerprinting</h3>
    <p>The following will allow web sites to know that the user interacting
    with the content is not a real user. This can be used to prevent denial
    of service attacks.
    <p>When the user agent creates a new session it MUST add a read only property
    to <code>window.navigator.webdriver</code>. The value should be set to
    <code>true</code> when WebDriver has an active session. When WebDriver does not have
    an active session then the value is equal to <code>false</code> or the property is removed.
