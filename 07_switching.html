  <h2>Where Commands Are Handled</h2>

  <p>Web applications can be composed of multiple windows and/or frames. For a normal user, the context in which an operation is performed is obvious: it's the window or frame that currently has OS focus and which has just received user input. The WebDriver API does not follow this convention. There is an expectation that many browsers using the WebDriver API may be used at the same time on the same machine. This section describes how WebDriver tracks which window or frame is currently the context in which commands are being executed.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Default Content</h2>

    <p>WebDriver's <dfn id="default-content">default content</dfn> is [[!html51]]'s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context">top level browsing context</a> that is currently receiving WebDriver commands.</p>

    <p>When a WebDriver instance is started and a single browser window is opened, the <a href="#default-content">default content</a> of that window is automatically selected for receiving further commands. If more than one window is opened when the session starts, then the user MUST first select which window to act upon using the <code>switchToWindow</code> command. Until the user selects a window, all commands must return a status code of <code><a href="#status-no-such-window">no such window</a></code>.</p>

        <p>The "switchToWindow" command is used to select which window MUST be used as the context for processing commands. In order to determine which window should be used for accepting commands, the "switchToWindow" command MUST iterate over all windows comparing the window handle.

        <p>If no windows match, then a "<code><a href="#status-no-such-window">no such window</a></code>" status code MUST be returned, otherwise the "<a href="#default-content">default content</a>" of the first window to match will be selected for accepting commands.</p>

          <dt><a>WebElement</a> or unsigned short? id</dt>
          <dd>The identifier used for a frame.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>The "switchToFrame" command is used to select which frame within a window MUST be used as the context for handling future commands. All frame switching is taken from the current context from which commands are currently being handled. The "<code>id</code>" parameter can be an unsigned short or a <a>WebElement</a>. WebDriver implementations MUST determine which frame to select using the following algorithm:

        <ol>
          <li>If the "id" is a unsigned short the current context is set to the equivalent of the JS expression "window.frames[id]" where "id" is the number and "window" is the Document window represented by the current context.</li>
          <li>If the "id" is null, the current context is set to the <a href='#default-content'>default content</a>.</li>
          <li>If the "id" represents a <a>WebElement</a>, and the corresponding Document element represents a FRAME or an IFRAME, and the <a>WebElement</a> is part of the current context, the "window" property of that Document element becomes the current context.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In all cases if no match is made a "<code><a href="#status-no-such-frame">no such frame</a></code>" status code MUST be returned.</p>

        <p>If the indicated frame exists, frame switching MUST succeed even if doing so would violate the normal security constraints in place within the Javascript sandbox.</p></dd>
      <dt>void switchToParentFrame()</dt>
      <dd>
        <table class="simple jsoncommand">
          <tr>
            <th>HTTP Method</th>
            <th>Path Template</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>POST</td>
            <td>/session/{sessionId}/frame/parent</td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>The "switchToParentFrame" command MUST set the context of future commands to the <code>window.parent</code>. If the current context is the [[!html51]]'s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context">top level browsing context</a>, the context remains unchanged.</p>
