<h2>Where Commands Are Handled</h2>
  
<p>Web applications can be composed of multiple windows and/or frames. For a normal user, the context in which an operation is performed is obvious: it's the window or frame that currently has OS focus and which has just received user input. The WebDriver API does not follow this convention. There is an expectation that many browsers using the WebDriver API may be used at the same time on the same machine. This section describes how WebDriver tracks which window or frame is currently the context in which commands are being executed.</p>
    
<section>
<h2>Default Content</h2>

<p>WebDriver's <dfn id="default-content">default content</dfn> is [[!HTML5]]'s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context">top level browsing context</a> for the window that is currently receiving WebDriver commands.</p>

<p>When a WebDriver instance is started and a single browser window is opened, the default content of that window is automatically selected for receiving further commands. If more than one window is opened when the session starts, then the user MUST first select which window to act upon using the <code>switchToWindow</code> command. Until the user selects a window, all commands must return a status code of <code><a href="#status-no-such-window">no such window</a></code>.</p>

<h2>Switching Windows</h2>

<table class="simple">
	<tr>
		<td>Command Name</td>
		<td>switchToWindow</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Parameters</td>
		<td>"sessionId" {string} The key that identifies which session this request is for.<br/>
		    "name" {string} The identifier used for a window.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>Return Value</td>
	    <td>None</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>Errors</td>
	    <td><code><a href="#status-no-such-window">no such window</a></code> if no matching window can be found</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The "switchToWindow" command is used to select which window should currently be accepting commands. In order to determine which window should be used for accepting commands, the "switchToWindow" command MUST iterate over all windows. For each window, the following MUST be compared --- in this order --- with the "name" parameter:
    
    <ol>
        <li>A window handle, obtained from "getWindowHandles" or "getWindowHandle".</li>
        <li>The window name, as defined when the window was opened (the value of "window.name")</li>
        <li>The "id" attribute of the window.</li>
    </ol>

<p>If no windows match, then a "<code>NoSuchWindow</code>" status code MUST be returned, otherwise the "<a href="#default-content">default content</a>" of the first window to match will be selected for accepting commands.</p>

<h2>Switching Frames</h2>

<table class="simple">
	<tr>
		<td>Command Name</td>
		<td>switchToFrame</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Parameters</td>
		<td>"sessionId" {string} The key that identifies which session this request is for.<br>
		    "id" {?(string|number|!WebElement=)} The identifier used for a window.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>Return Value</td>
	    <td>None</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>Errors</td>
	    <td><code><a href="#status-no-such-frame">no such frame</a></code> if no matching frame can be found</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The "switchToFrame" command is used to select which frame within a window should be used for handling future commands. All frame switching is taken from the current context from which commands are currently being handled. The "id" parameter can be one of a string, number of an element. WebDriver implementations MUST determine which frame to select using the following algorithm:

<ol>
    <li>If the "id" is a number the current context is set to the equivalent of the JS expression "window.frames[n]" where "n" is the number and "window" is the DOM window represented by the current context.</li>
    <li>If the "id" is null, the current context is set to the default context.</li>
    <li>If the "id" is a string:
        <ol>
            <li>If the JS expression "window.frames[id]" evaluated in the current context returns a window, where "id" is the value of the the "id" parameter, the current context is set to that.</li>
            <li>Otherwise for each value of "window.frames" (referred to as <code>win</code>):
                <ol>
                    <li>If <code>win</code> has a "name" property or attribute equal to the "id" parameter, this becomes the current context.</li>
                    <li>If <code>win</code> has an "id" property or attribute equal to the "id" parameter, this becomes the current context.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>If the "id" represents a <code>WebElement</code>, and the corresponding DOM element represents a FRAME or an IFRAME, and the WebElement is part of the current context, the "window" property of that DOM element becomes the current context.</li>
</ol>

<p>In all cases if no match is made a "<code><a href="#status-no-such-frame">no such frame</a></code>" status code MUST be returned.</p>

<p>Frame switching MUST succeed even if doing so would cross a security origin, or javascript executing in window.top's context would otherwise not be able to access the frame being switched to.</p>

	<h2>Switching to Hosted Shadow DOMs</h2>

	<table class="simple">
		<tr>
			<th>Capability Name</th><th>Type</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><span class="capability-shadowDom">shadowDom</span></td><td>boolean</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p>If a browser implements the Shadow DOM specification, it MUST support the ability to access shadow subtrees. This is done using the switchToSubTree command:</p>

	<table class="simple">
		<tr>
			<td>Command Name</td>
			<td>switchToSubTree</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Parameters</td>
			<td>"sessionId" {string} The key that identifies which session this request is for.<br>
		    	"element" {!WebElement=} The shadow host.<br>
				"index" {int} The index of the shadow subtree. Defaults to 0.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
	    	<td>Return Value</td>
	   		<td>None</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
	    	<td>Errors</td>
	    	<td><code><a href="#status-no-such-dom">no such dom</a></code> if the element is not a shadow host, or if the indexed shadow subtree does not exist.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

<p>When executing this command, Shadow DOM subtrees are indexed in the order that they were added to the host. That is, the "oldest" subtree is at index 0, and the "youngest" subtree at the highest sequentially numbered index.</p>

<p>Where the Shadow DOM is supported, all commands in WebDriver MUST operate on the currently selected Shadow DOM subtree unless the command itself declares otherwise.</p>
