  <h2>Where Commands Are Handled</h2>

  <p>Web applications can be composed of multiple windows and/or frames. For a normal user, the context in which an operation is performed is obvious: it's the window or frame that currently has OS focus and which has just received user input. The WebDriver API does not follow this convention. There is an expectation that many browsers using the WebDriver API may be used at the same time on the same machine. This section describes how WebDriver tracks which window or frame is currently the context in which commands are being executed.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Default Content</h2>

    <p>WebDriver's <dfn id="default-content">default content</dfn> is [[!HTML5]]'s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context">top level browsing context</a> for the window that is currently receiving WebDriver commands.</p>

    <p>When a WebDriver instance is started and a single browser window is opened, the <a href="#default-content">default content</a> of that window is automatically selected for receiving further commands. If more than one window is opened when the session starts, then the user MUST first select which window to act upon using the <code>switchToWindow</code> command. Until the user selects a window, all commands must return a status code of <code><a href="#status-no-such-window">no such window</a></code>.</p>

    <h2>Switching Windows</h2>

    <dl class='idl' title='partial interface WebDriver'>
      <dt>void switchToWindow()</dt>
      <dd>
        <dl class='parameters'>
          <dt>DOMString name</dt>
          <dd>The identifier used for a window</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>The "switchToWindow" command is used to select which window MUST be used as the context for processing commands. In order to determine which window should be used for accepting commands, the "switchToWindow" command MUST iterate over all windows. For each window, the following MUST be compared &mdash; in this order &mdash; with the "name" parameter:

        <ol>
          <li>A window handle, obtained from "getWindowHandles" or "getWindowHandle".</li>
          <li>The window name, as defined when the window was opened (the value of "window.name")</li>
          <li>The "id" attribute of the window.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If no windows match, then a "<code><a href="#status-no-such-window">no such window</a></code>" status code MUST be returned, otherwise the "<a href="#default-content">default content</a>" of the first window to match will be selected for accepting commands.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Switching Frames</h2>
    <dl class='idl' title='partial interface WebDriver'>
      <dt>void switchToFrame()</dt>
      <dd>
        <dl class='parameters'>
          <dt>WebElement or DOMString or number? id</dt>
          <dd>The identifier used for a frame.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>The "switchToFrame" command is used to select which frame within a window MUST be used as the context for handling future commands. All frame switching is taken from the current context from which commands are currently being handled. The "<code>id</code>" parameter can be one of a string, number of an element. WebDriver implementations MUST determine which frame to select using the following algorithm:

        <ol>
          <li>If the "id" is a number the current context is set to the equivalent of the JS expression "window.frames[n]" where "n" is the number and "window" is the DOM window represented by the current context.</li>
          <li>If the "id" is null, the current context is set to the default context.</li>
          <li>If the "id" is a string:
            <ol>
              <li>If the JS expression "window.frames[id]" evaluated in the current context returns a window, where "id" is the value of the the "id" parameter, the current context is set to that.</li>
              <li>Otherwise for each value of "window.frames" (referred to as <code>win</code>):
                <ol>
                  <li>If <code>win</code> has a "name" property or attribute equal to the "id" parameter, this becomes the current context.</li>
                  <li>If <code>win</code> has an "id" property or attribute equal to the "id" parameter, this becomes the current context.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>If the "id" represents a <code>WebElement</code>, and the corresponding DOM element represents a FRAME or an IFRAME, and the WebElement is part of the current context, the "window" property of that DOM element becomes the current context.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In all cases if no match is made a "<code><a href="#status-no-such-frame">no such frame</a></code>" status code MUST be returned.</p>

        <p>If the indicated frame exists, frame switching MUST succeed even if doing so would violate the normal security constraints in place within the Javascript sandbox.</p></dd>
