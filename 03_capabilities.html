  <h2>Browser Capabilities</h2>
  <p>Different browsers support different levels of various specifications. For example, some support SVG or the CSS
  Selector API, but only browsers that implement HTML5 will support LocalStorage. The WebDriver API provides
  a mechanism to query the supported capabilities of a browser. Each broad area of functionality
  within the WebDriver API has an associated capability string. Whether a particular capability MUST or MAY
  be supported --- as well as fallback mechanisms for handling those cases where a capability is not supported --- is
  discussed where the capability string is defined.</p>

    <h3>Capabilities</h3>
  <dl class="idl" title="interface Capabilities">
    <dt>readonly attribute object capabilities</dt>
    <dd>The underlying collection of capabilities, represented as a dictionary mapping strings to values which may be
    of type boolean, numerical or string.</dd>
    <dt>boolean has(string capabilityName)</dt>
    <dd>Queries the underlying <code>capabilities</code> to see whether the value is set. This will return true if the capabilities contain a key with the given <code>capabilityName</code> and the value of that key is defined. If the value is a boolean, this function will return that boolean value.</dd>
    <dt>object get(string capabilityName)</dt>
    <dd>Get the value of the key matching capabilityName in the underlying<code>capabilities</code>or <code>null</code>if no value is defined.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>A <code>Capabilities</code> instance MUST be immutable. If a mutable <code>Capabilities</code> instance is required, then the <code>MutableCapabilities</code> MUST be used instead.</p>

  <h3>MutableCapabilities</h3>
  <dl class="idl" title="interface MutableCapabilities : Capabilities">
    <dt>void set(string capabilityName, object value)</dt>
    <dd>Set the value of the given <code>capabilityName</code>to the given <code>value</code>. If the value is not a boolean, numerical type or a string, a <code>WebDriverException</code>should be thrown.</dd>
