  <h2>Browser Capabilities</h2>
  <p>Different browsers support different levels of various specifications. For example, some support SVG or the [[!SELECTORS-API]], but only browsers that implement [[!WEBSTORAGE]] will support <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-webstorage-20090910/#the-localstorage-attribute">LocalStorage</a>. The WebDriver API provides a mechanism to query the supported capabilities of a browser. Each broad area of functionality within the WebDriver API has an associated capability string. Whether a particular capability MUST or MAY be supported &mdash; as well as fallback mechanisms for handling those cases where a capability is not supported &mdash; is discussed where the capability string is defined.</p>

    <h3>Capabilities</h3>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface Capabilities">
      <dt>readonly attribute dictionary capabilities</dt>
      <dd>The underlying collection of capabilities, represented as a dictionary mapping strings to values which may be
      of type <code>boolean</code>, <code>numerical</code> or <code>DOMString</code>. The default value is an empty dictionary.</dd>
      <dt>boolean has(DOMString capabilityName)</dt>
      <dd>Queries the underlying <code>capabilities</code> to see whether the
      value is set. This MUST return true if the capabilities contain a key with
      the given <code>capabilityName</code> and the value of that key is defined.
      If the value is a boolean, this function MUST return that boolean value. If
      the value is <code>null</code>, an empty string or a 0 then this method MUST return
      false.</dd>
      <dt>(DOMString or boolean or long)? get(DOMString capabilityName)</dt>
      <dd>Get the value of the key matching capabilityName in the underlying <code>capabilities</code> or <code>null</code> if no value is  defined.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>A <code>Capabilities</code> instance MUST be immutable. If a mutable <code>Capabilities</code> instance is required, then the <code>MutableCapabilities</code> MUST be used instead.</p>

    <p class="note">The "has" method is designed to provide a quick boolean check on whether or not a particular capability is set and can be used in an "if" statement in many languages. The "get" method returns the exact value. In the case of boolean values, this will be the same result as if "truthy" values are used (that is: <code>get('falseValue')</code> and <code>get('unsetValue')</code> are both false).</p>
