  <h2>Browser Capabilities</h2>
  <p>Different browsers support different levels of various specifications. For example, some support SVG or the CSS
  Selector API, but only browsers that implement HTML5 will support LocalStorage. The WebDriver API provides
  a mechanism to query the supported capabilities of a browser. Each broad area of functionality
  within the WebDriver API has an associated capability string. Whether a particular capability MUST or MAY
  be supported &mdash; as well as fallback mechanisms for handling those cases
  where a capability is not supported &mdash; is
  discussed where the capability string is defined.</p>

    <h3>Capabilities</h3>
  <dl class="idl" title="interface Capabilities">
    <dt>readonly attribute dictionary capabilities</dt>
    <dd>The underlying collection of capabilities, represented as a dictionary mapping strings to values which may be
    of type <code>boolean</code>, <code>numerical</code> or <code>string</code>. The default value is an empty dictionary.</dd>
    <dt>boolean has(string capabilityName)</dt>
    <dd>Queries the underlying <code>capabilities</code> to see whether the
    value is set. This MUST return true if the capabilities contain a key with
    the given <code>capabilityName</code> and the value of that key is defined.
    If the value is a boolean, this function MUST return that boolean value. If
    the value is <code>null</code>, an empty string or a 0 then this method MUST return
    false.</dd>
    <dt>(string or boolean or number)? get(string capabilityName)</dt>
    <dd>Get the value of the key matching capabilityName in the underlying <code>capabilities</code> or <code>null</code>if no value is defined.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>A <code>Capabilities</code> instance MUST be immutable. If a mutable <code>Capabilities</code> instance is required, then the <code>MutableCapabilities</code> MUST be used instead.</p>

  <p class="note">The "has" method is designed to provide a quick boolean check on whether or not a particular capability is set and can be used in an "if" statement in many languages. The "get" method returns the exact value. In the case of boolean values, this will be the same result as if "truthy" values are used (that is: <code>get('falseValue')</code> and <code>get('unsetValue')</code> are both false).</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>MutableCapabilities</h3>
  <dl class="idl" title="interface MutableCapabilities : Capabilities">
    <dt>void set(string capabilityName, (string or boolean or number)? value)</dt>
    <dd>Set the value of the given <code>capabilityName</code>to the given <code>value</code>. If the value is not a boolean, numerical type, a string or the null value a <code>WebDriverException</code> SHOULD be thrown.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>In the case where the local and remote end are in the same process, it SHOULD be acceptable to use other types with the <code>set</code> method. If this is allowed, the value MUST be serialized to one of the acceptable types (boolean, numerical type, a string or the null value) before being sent out of process (such as transmitting from the local to the remote end). If this serialization is not possible, a <code>WebDriverException</code> MUST be thrown.</p>

  <div class="note">
	<p>As an example, perhaps the browser being automated supports user profiles. This may be modelled in code as a "Profile" object, leading to code such as:</p>
	<pre class="code">
		profile = Profile("some/user/directory")
		capabilities = MutableCapabilities()
		capabilities.set('profile', profile)
		driver = RemoteDriver(profile)
    </pre>

    <p>In this example, the profile represents a directory on the local disk. One way to serialize this would be to zip the contents of this profile and then encode it using base64 to allow it to be passed as a string.</p>
