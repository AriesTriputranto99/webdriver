  <h2>Commands and Responses</h2>
  <p>The communication between the remote and local ends is performed via Command and Response objects. How these are encoded and transmitted between the remote and local ends is left undefined, but a non-normative implementation of this as JSON over HTTP is
  given in appendix XXXX.</p>

  <div class="note">
	<p>Although the encoding and transport mechanism is left undefined in this specification, implementors of the remote end SHOULD provide an implementation that allows the local end to use the JSON over HTTP protocol. This MAY take the form of a standalone executable that translates the JSON over HTTP protocol to the encoding and transport mechanism used by the remote end.</p>
  </div>

  <section>
    <h3>Command</h3>
    <p>A command represents a call to the remote end of the WebDriver API.</p>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface Command">
      <dt>attribute string name</dt>
      <dd>The case-sensitive name of the command to execute. The default value is the null value.</dd>
      <dt>attribute dictionary parameters</dt>
      <dd>A map of the named parameters to an object representing its value. The default value is an empty array.</dd>
      <dt>attribute string sessionId</dt>
      <dd>A reference to the session to which this command is associated. The default value is the null value.</dd>
    </dl>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Response</h3>
    <p>A response represents the value returned from the remote end of the WebDriver API.</p>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface Response">
      <dt>readonly attribute string sessionId</dt>
      <dd>A reference to the session to which this command is associated. The default value is the null value.</dd>
      <dt>readonly attribute integer status</dt>
      <dd>The status code representing the success or failure of the method. Anything other than 0 indicates a failure
      of some kind. The default value is 0.</dd>
      <dt>readonly attribute object value</dt>
      <dd>The return value of the method call. It's type is determined by the <code>Command</code> that has been executed. In the specification, each command definition will make clear what the expected return type is. The default value is the null value.</dd>
    </dl>

	<p>There is no requirement that implementations of Command and Response exhibit any behaviour: they MAY be simple data structures. Reading of values MUST be idempotent, and writing any particular value MUST NOT cause any other values on the Command or Response to change.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Processing Additional Fields on Commands and Responses</h3>
    
    <p>Any Command or Response MAY contain additional fields than those listed
    above. The content of fields MUST be maintained, unaltered by any
    intermediate processing nodes. There is no requirement to maintain the
    ordering of fields.</p>
    
    <div class="note">
      <p>This requirement exists to allow for extension of the protocol, and to allow implementors to decorate Commands and Responses with additional information, perhaps giving context to a series of messages or providing security information.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>Error Codes</h3>
    <p>The WebDriver API indicates the success or failure of a command invocation via a status code on the 
    <a>Response</a> object. The following values are used and have the following meanings.</p>

    <h2>Handling of Error Codes at the Local End</h2>
    
    <p>Error codes are returned from the remote end to the local end. The local end SHOULD convert these into a form appropriate for the implementation language. For example, in C the error codes might be returned "as is", whereas in Java various exceptions could be thrown.</p>
    
    <p>Local implementations written in languages that support exceptions SHOULD make use of an exception hierarchy rooted on a <code>WebDriverException</code> (or similarly named base exception class). Where references to <code>WebDriverException</code> are made in this specification, we are referring to this local end conversion of error codes to local end exceptions.</p>
    
    <p class="note">The reason for this is to allow users of the local end to easily handle the all expected failure modes of a local WebDriver implementation by catching the <code>WebDriverException</code>.</p>
      
     <p class="note">It is strongly recommended that the <code>WebDriverException</code> contain as much diagnostic information as possible, including version numbers and details about the remote end. This is because experience suggests that when reporting errors from tests using WebDriver, users will simply cut-and-paste a stack trace of an exception. Adding this information to the exception makes the task of debugging problems considerably easier.</p>
