  <h2>Commands and Responses</h2>
  <p>The WebDriver API is designed to be used both in-process and out-of-process. The IDL listed in Appendix
  XXXX SHOULD be used as the basis for the user-facing API. When used out-of-process, the WebDriver API
  defines command/repsonse objects that MUST be used. How these are encoded and transmitted between the browser being
  automated and the user of the API is left undefined, but a non-normative implementation of this as JSON over HTTP is
  given in appendix XXXX.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Command</h3>
    <p>A command represents a call to the remote end of the WebDriver API.</p>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface Command">
      <dt>attribute string sessionId</dt>
      <dd>A reference to the session to which this command is associated.</dd>
      <dt>attribute string name</dt>
      <dd>The case-sensitive name of the command to execute</dd>
      <dt>attribute dictionary parameters</dt>
      <dd>A map of the named parameters to an object representing its value.</dd>
    </dl>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Response</h3>
    <p>A response represents the value returned from remote end of the WebDriver API.</p>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface Response">
      <dt>readonly attribute string sessionId</dt>
      <dd>A reference to the session to which this command is associated.</dd>
      <dt>readonly attribute integer status</dt>
      <dd>The status code representing the success or failure of the method. Anything other than 0 indicates a failure
      of some kind</dd>
      <dt>readonly attribute object value</dt>
      <dd>The return value of the method call. It's type is determined by the <code>Command</code> that has been executed. In the specification, each command definition will make clear what the expected return type is.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Processing Additional Fields on Commands and Responses</h3>
    
    <p>Any Command or Response MAY contain additional fields than those listed above. These fields MUST be maintained, unaltered by any intermediate processing nodes. There is no requirement to maintain the ordering of fields.</p>
    
    <div class="note">
      <p>This requirement exists to allow for extension of the protocol, and to allow implementors to decorate Commands and Responses with additional information, perhaps giving context to a series of messages. or providing security information.</p>

    <h3>Error Codes</h3>
    <p>The WebDriver API indicates the success or failure of a command invocation via a status code on the 
    <code>Response</code>object. The following values are used and have the following meanings.</p>
    <!-- TODO: These values are derived from existing common usage. Do they need to be reconsidered? -->
