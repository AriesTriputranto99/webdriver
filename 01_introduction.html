  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The WebDriver API aims to provide a synchronous API that can be used for a variety of use cases, though
  it is primarily designed to support automated testing of web apps.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Intended Audience</h3>
    <p>This specification is intended for implementors of the WebDriver API. It is not intended as light bed
    time reading.</p>

    <h3>Relationship of WebDriver API and Existing Specifications</h3>
    <p>Where possible and appropriate, the WebDriver API references existing specifications. For example, the
    list of boolean attributes for elements is drawn from the 
    <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html">HTML5 specification</a>. When references are made, this
    specification will link to the relevant sections.</p>

    <h3>Naming the Two Sides of the API</h3>
    
    <p>The WebDriver API can be thought of as a client/server process. However, implementation details can mean that this terminology becomes confusing. For this reason, the two sides of the API are called the "local" and the "remote" ends.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Local</dt>
      <dd>The user-facing API. Command objects are sent and Response objects are
      consumed by the local end of the WebDriver API. It can be thought of as
      being "local" to the user of the API.</dd>
      
      <dt>Remote</dt>
      <dd>The implementation of the user-facing API. Command objects are
      consumed and Response objects are sent by the remote end of the WebDriver
      API. The implementation of the remote end may be on machine remote from
      the user of the local end.</dd>
      
    </dl>
    
    <p>There is no requirement that the local and remote ends be in different processes.</p>
