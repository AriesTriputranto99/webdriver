    <h2>Defining "window" and "frame"</h2>

    <p>Within this specification, a window equates to [[!html51]]'s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context">top level browsing context</a>. Put another way, within this spec browser tabs are counted as separate windows.</p>

        <p>Each window has a "window handle" associated with it. This is an opaque string which MUST uniquely identify the window within the session and MUST NOT be "current". This MAY be a UUID. The "getWindowHandle" command can be used to obtain the window handle for the window that commands are currently acting upon.</p>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>This array of returned strings MUST contain a handle for every window associated with the browser session and no others. For each returned window handle the javascript expression "window.top.closed" (or equivalent) MUST evaluate to false at the time the command is being executed.</p>

    <p>The ordering of the array elements is not defined, but MAY be determined by iterating over each top level browser window and returning the tabs within that window before iterating over the tabs of the next top level browser window. For example, in the diagram below, the window handles should be returned as the handles for: win1tab1, win1tab2, win2.</p>

    <img src="example-windows.png" alt="Two top level windows. The first window has two tabs, lablled win1tab1 and win1tab2. The second window has only one tab labelled win2"/>

    <p class="note">This implies that the correct way to determine whether or not a particular interaction with the browser opens a new window is done by obtaining the set of window handles before the interaction is performed and comparing with the set after the action is performed.</p></dd>

          </table>

        <p>The close command closes the window that <a>Command</a>s are currently being sent to. If this means that a call to get the list of window handles would return an empty list, then this close command MUST be the equivalent of calling "quit". That is, if the final window of a session is closed, then the session quits.</p>

        <p>Once the window has closed, future commands MUST return a status code of <code><a href="#status-no-such-window">no such window</a></code> until a new window is selected for receiving commands.</p>
