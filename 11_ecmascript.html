      <p>Open questions: What happens if a user's JS triggers a modal dialog?
      Blocking seems like a reasonable idea, but there is an assumption that
      WebDriver is not threadsafe.
      
      What happens to unhandled JS errors? Caused by a user's JS? Caused by JS
      on a page? How does a user of the API obtain the list of errors? Is that
      list cleared upon read?
