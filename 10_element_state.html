    <h2>Determining Visibility</h2>
      <p>The following algorithm is used to determine if an element has been displayed.
        <ul>
          <li>The element must be shown in the viewport in the browser</li>
          <li>The element has a height and width greater than 0px.</li>
          <li>The element, or an ancestor, must not have a visibility that is hidden or a
          display property that is none. </li>
          <li>OPTIONs and OPTGROUP are treated as special cases, they are considered shown if and
          only if the enclosing select element is visible.</li>
          <li>MAP elelemnts are shown if and only if the image it uses is visible. Areas within
          a map are shown if the enclosing Map is visible.</li>
          <li>Any INPUT elements of type hidden will not be visibile</li>
          <li>Any NOSCRIPT elements will not be visible</li>
          <li>The element should be hidden if their parent has a fixed size AND has the
          CSS style of "overflow:hidden" and the element's location is not within the fixed
          size of the parent</li>
        </ul>
