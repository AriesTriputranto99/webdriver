    <h2>Determining Visibility</h2>
      <p>The following algorithm is used to determine if an element has been displayed.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The element has a height and width greater than 0px.</li>
        <li>The element, or an ancestor, must not be visible if that element, or its ancestor,
        is hidden or has a display property that is none.</li>
        <li>OPTIONs and OPTGROUP are treated as special cases, they are considered shown if and
        only if the enclosing select element is visible.</li>
        <li>MAP elements are shown if and only if the image it uses is visible. Areas within
        a map are shown if the enclosing MAP is visible.</li>
        <li>Any INPUT elements of "type=hidden" are not visible</li>
        <li>Any NOSCRIPT elements will not be visible</li>
        <li>The element MUST be hidden if their ancestor has a fixed size AND has the
        CSS style of "overflow:hidden" and the element's location is not within the fixed
        size of the parent</li>
      </ul>

          the DOM</td>
