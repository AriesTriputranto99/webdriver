<section id="abstract">
<p>This specification defines the WebDriver API, a platform-and language-neutral interface that allows programs or scripts to introspect into, and control the behaviour of, a web browser. The WebDriver API is primarily intended to allow developers to write tests that automate a browser from a separate controlling process, but may also be implemented in such a way as to allow in-browser scripts to control a (separate?) browser.</p>

<p>The WebDriver API is defined by a set of interfaces to discover and manipulate DOM elements on a page, and to control the behaviour of the containing browser.</p>

<p>This specification also includes a non-normative reference serialisation (to JSON) of the interface's invocations and responses that may be useful for browser vendors.</p>

<p>If you wish to make comments regarding this document, please email feedback to <a href="mailto:public-browser-tools-testing@w3.org">public-browser-tools-testing@w3.org</a>. All feedback is welcome, and the editors will read and consider all feedback.</p>

<p>This specification is still under active development and may not be stable. Any implementors who are not actively participating in the preparation of this specification may find unexpected changes occurring. It is suggested that any implementors join the WG for this specification. Despite not being stable, it should be noted that this specification is strongly based on an existing Open Source project &mdash; <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/">Selenium WebDriver</a> &mdash; and the existing implementations of the API defined within that project.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The WebDriver API aims to provide a synchronous API that can be used for a variety of use cases, though
  it is primarily designed to support automated testing of web apps.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Intended Audience</h3>
    <p>This specification is intended for implementors of the WebDriver API. It is not intended as light bed
    time reading.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Relationship of WebDriver API and Existing Specifications</h3>
    <p>Where possible and appropriate, the WebDriver API references existing specifications. For example, the
    list of boolean attributes for elements is drawn from the 
    <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html">HTML5 specification</a>. When references are made, this
    specification will link to the relevant sections.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Naming the Two Sides of the API</h3>
    
    <p>The WebDriver API can be thought of as a client/server process. However, implementation details can mean that this terminology becomes confusing. For this reason, the two sides of the API are called the "local" and the "remote" ends.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Local</dt>
      <dd>The user-facing API. Command objects are sent and Response objects are
      consumed by the local end of the WebDriver API. It can be thought of as
      being "local" to the user of the API.</dd>
      
      <dt>Remote</dt>
      <dd>The implementation of the user-facing API. Command objects are
      consumed and Response objects are sent by the remote end of the WebDriver
      API. The implementation of the remote end may be on a machine remote from
      the user of the local end.</dd>
      
    </dl>
    
    <p>There is no requirement that the local and remote ends be in different processes. The IDL given in this specification and summarized in Appendix XXXX SHOULD be used as the basis for any conforming local implementation.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Conformance Requirements</h3>
    
    <p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>
    
    <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in [[!RFC2119]]. The key word "OPTIONALLY" in the normative parts of this document is to be interpreted with the same normative meaning as "MAY" and "OPTIONAL".</p>
    
    <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent.</p>
    
    <section>
      <h3>Conformance Classes</h3>
      
      <p>This specification describes the conformance criteria for both local (relevant to creating bindings for languages) and remote end implementations (relevant to browser vendors and server implementors).</p>
    </section>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Commands and Responses</h2>
  <p>The communication between the remote and local ends is performed via Command and Response objects. How these are encoded and transmitted between the remote and local ends is left undefined, but a non-normative implementation of this as JSON over HTTP is
  given in appendix XXXX.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>Command</h3>
    <p>A command represents a call to the remote end of the WebDriver API.</p>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface Command">
      <dt>attribute string name</dt>
      <dd>The case-sensitive name of the command to execute. The default value is the null value.</dd>
      <dt>attribute dictionary parameters</dt>
      <dd>A map of the named parameters to an object representing its value. The default value is an empty array.</dd>
      <dt>attribute string sessionId</dt>
      <dd>A reference to the session to which this command is associated. The default value is the null value.</dd>
    </dl>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Response</h3>
    <p>A response represents the value returned from the remote end of the WebDriver API.</p>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface Response">
      <dt>readonly attribute string sessionId</dt>
      <dd>A reference to the session to which this command is associated. The default value is the null value.</dd>
      <dt>readonly attribute integer status</dt>
      <dd>The status code representing the success or failure of the method. Anything other than 0 indicates a failure
      of some kind. The default value is 0.</dd>
      <dt>readonly attribute object value</dt>
      <dd>The return value of the method call. It's type is determined by the <code>Command</code> that has been executed. In the specification, each command definition will make clear what the expected return type is. The default value is the null value.</dd>
    </dl>

	<p>There is no requirement that implementations of Command and Response exhibit any behaviour: they MAY be simple data structures. Reading of values MUST be idempotent, and writing any particular value MUST NOT cause any other values on the Command or Response to change.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Processing Additional Fields on Commands and Responses</h3>
    
    <p>Any Command or Response MAY contain additional fields than those listed
    above. The content of fields MUST be maintained, unaltered by any
    intermediate processing nodes. There is no requirement to maintain the
    ordering of fields.</p>
    
    <div class="note">
      <p>This requirement exists to allow for extension of the protocol, and to allow implementors to decorate Commands and Responses with additional information, perhaps giving context to a series of messages. or providing security information.</p>
    </div>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Error Codes</h3>
    <p>The WebDriver API indicates the success or failure of a command invocation via a status code on the 
    <a>Response</a>object. The following values are used and have the following meanings.</p>
    <!-- TODO: These values are derived from existing common usage. Do they need to be reconsidered? -->

  <h2>Browser Capabilities</h2>
  <p>Different browsers support different levels of various specifications. For example, some support SVG or the CSS
  Selector API, but only browsers that implement HTML5 will support LocalStorage. The WebDriver API provides
  a mechanism to query the supported capabilities of a browser. Each broad area of functionality
  within the WebDriver API has an associated capability string. Whether a particular capability MUST or MAY
  be supported &mdash; as well as fallback mechanisms for handling those cases
  where a capability is not supported &mdash; is
  discussed where the capability string is defined.</p>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Capabilities</h3>
  <dl class="idl" title="interface Capabilities">
    <dt>readonly attribute dictionary capabilities</dt>
    <dd>The underlying collection of capabilities, represented as a dictionary mapping strings to values which may be
    of type <code>boolean</code>, <code>numerical</code> or <code>string</code>.</dd>
    <dt>boolean has(string capabilityName)</dt>
    <dd>Queries the underlying <code>capabilities</code> to see whether the
    value is set. This will return true if the capabilities contain a key with
    the given <code>capabilityName</code> and the value of that key is defined.
    If the value is a boolean, this function will return that boolean value. If
    the value is <code>null</code>, an empty string or a 0 then this method will return
    false.</dd>
    <dt>(string or boolean or number)? get(string capabilityName)</dt>
    <dd>Get the value of the key matching capabilityName in the underlying <code>capabilities</code> or  <code>null</code>if no value is defined.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>A <code>Capabilities</code> instance MUST be immutable. If a mutable <code>Capabilities</code> instance is required, then the <code>MutableCapabilities</code> MUST be used instead.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>MutableCapabilities</h3>
  <dl class="idl" title="interface MutableCapabilities : Capabilities">
    <dt>void set(string capabilityName, (string or boolean or number)? value)</dt>
    <dd>Set the value of the given <code>capabilityName</code>to the given <code>value</code>. If the value is not a boolean, numerical type or a string, a <code>WebDriverException</code> should be thrown.</dd>
  </dl>
</section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Sessions</h2>
  <p>Non-normative summary: A session is equivalent to a single instantiation of a particular browser, including all
  child windows. The WebDriver API gives each session a UUID stored as a string that can be used to differentiate one
  session from another, allowing multiple browsers to be controlled on the same machine if needed, and allowing
  sessions to be routed via a multiplexer. This ID is sent with every <a>Command</a> and returned with every 
  <a>Response</a> and is stored on the <code>sessionId</code> field.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Creating a Session</h3>
    <p>The process for successfully creating a session follows.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The local end creates a new Capabilities or MutableCapabilities instance describing the desired capabilities
      for the session. The Capabilities object MAY be empty, but MUST be defined.</li>
      <li>The local end creates a new Command with the "name" being "newSession" and the "parameters" containing an
      entry named "desiredCapabilities" with the value set to the Capabilities instance from the previous step. An optional
      "requiredCapabilities" entry MAY also be created and populated with a Capabilities instance. The "sessionId" fields
      SHOULD be left empty.</li>
      <li>The Command is serialized and transmitted to the remote end.</li>
      <li>The remote end examines the two Capabilities parameters, and creates a new session matching as many of the Capabilities as
      possible from the "desiredCapabilities" and all of the Capabilities given in the "requiredCapabilities".
      How the new session is created depends on the implementation of this specification. In the case of a
      browser automation framework, it is expected that a new instance of the browser is started if possible.
        <ul>
          <li>If any of the "requiredCapabilities" cannot be fulfilled by the new session, the remote end MUST quit the session and return the
            <code>SessionNotCreatedException</code> error code. The error message SHOULD list all unmet required capabilities though only the 
            first unmet required capability MUST be given.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The session must be assigned a UUID which MUST be unique for each session (by definition). Generating the UUID
      MAY occur before the session is created. If the Command object had the "sessionId" field set, this MAY be
      discarded in favour of the freshly generated UUID. Because of this, it is
      recommended that UUID generation be done on the remote end. If the UUID has already been used, a Response MUST be sent with the status 
      code set to <code>SessionNotCreatedException</code> and the value being an explanation that the UUID has previously been used.</li>
      <li>The remote end create a new Response object. 
      <ul>
        <li>The "sessionId" field is assigned the UUID associated with this session.</li>
        <li>The session is described by filling a Capabilities instance with keys matching the parts of this
        specification that can be fulfilled. This is assigned to the "value" field of the Response. This fields MUST
        be filled</li>
        <li>The "status" field is set to the <code>SUCCESS</code> error code.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>The Response is transmitted or returned back to the local end.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There is no requirement for the local end to validate that some or all of the fields sent on the Capabilities
    associated with the Command match those returned in the Response.</p>
    <section>
      <h3>Capability Names</h3>
      <p>The following keys are to be used in the Capabilities instances.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>browserName</dt>
        <dd>The name of the desired browser as a string</dd>
        <dt>browserVersion</dt>
        <dd>The version number of the browser, given as a string</dd>
        <dt>platformName</dt>
        <dd>The OS that the browser is running on, matching any of the platform names given below.</dd>
        <dt>platformVersion</dt>
        <dd>The version of the OS that the browser is running on as a string.</dd>
      </dl>

      <section>
        <h3>Platform Names</h3>
        <p>These SHOULD be named in the style of enums in C-like languages.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ANDROID</li>
          <li>IOS</li>
          <li>LINUX</li>
          <li>MAC</li>
          <li>UNIX</li>
          <li>WINDOWS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition "ANY" may be used to indicate the underlying OS is either unknown or does not matter.
        Implementors MAY add additional platform names.</p>

        <!-- TODO: Add section on comparing platforms -->

      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Error Handling</h3>
      <p>The following status codes MUST be returned by the "newSession" command. Please consult the table in the
      "commands" section for numerical values:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Success</dt>
        <dd>The session was successfully created. The "value" field of the Response MUST contain a Capabilities object
        describing the session</dd>
        <dt>Timeout</dt>
        <dd>The new session could not be created within the time allowed for command execution on the remote end. This
        time MAY be infinite. The "value" field of the Response SHOULD contain a string explaining that a timeout has
        occurred, but it MAY be left empty or filled with the empty string.</dd>
        <dt>UnknownError</dt>
        <dd>An unhandled error of some sort has occurred. The "value" field of the Response SHOULD contain a more detailed
        description of the error.</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Remote End Matching of Capabilities</h3>
      <p>This section is non-normative.</p>
      <p>The suggested order for comparing keys in the Capabilities instance when creating a session is:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>browserName</li>
        <li>browserVersion</li>
        <li>platform</li>
        <li>platformVersion</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For all comparisons, if the key is missing (as determined by a call to Capability.has()), that particular criteria shall not factor into the
      comparison.</p>
    </section>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Navigation</h2>
  
<p>Almost all usages of the WebDriver API begin by navigating to a particular URL. This section not only describes the commands used for navigation, but also describes when commands must be processed.</p>

<p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support navigating between different HTTP domains and between HTTPS and HTTP domains if the underlying browser supports this.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="page-load-strategies">Page Load Strategies</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>conservative</dt>
  <dd>The remote end MUST wait until all frames and iframes in the window currently be used to process commands
  that contain an HTML document are at "<a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/single-page.html#current-document-readiness">document.readyState</a> == 'complete'" and
  there are no outstanding HTTP requests, other than those caused by
  XMLHttpRequests. If a frame or iframe does not contain an HTML document, the remote
  end SHOULD wait until all HTTP traffic to that frame is complete.</dd>

  <dt>normal</dt>
  <dd>The remote ends MUST wait until the frame currently handling commands reaches
  "document.readyState == 'complete'" or there are no more outstanding
  network requests other than XMLHttpRequests.</dd>

  <dt>eager</dt>
  <dd>The remote end MUST wait until the frame currently handling commands reaches
  "document.readyState == 'interactive' || document.readyState ==
  'complete'" or there are no more outstanding network requests.</dd>
  
  <dt>none</dt>
  <dd>The remote end does not do any checks to see if a page load is currently active.</dd>
</dl>

<p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support the <code>normal</code> and <code>eager</code> modes and SHOULD support the <code>conservative</code> and <code>none</code> modes. If no page loading strategy is chosen, then <code>normal</code> MUST be the default.
In addition, implementors MAY add additional page loading strategies.</p>

<p>WebDriver implementations MUST support users accessing sites served via HTTPS. Access to those sites using self-signed or invalid certificates, and where the certificate does not match the serving domain MUST be the same as if the HTTPS was configured properly.</p>

<p class="note">The reason for this is that WebDriver instances are often used for testing. It's a sorry fact that many QA and testers are asked to verify that apps work on sites that have insecure HTTPS configurations</p>
</section>

<p>The exception to requirement is if the <code>Capabilities</code> used to initialize has the WebDriver session had the capability <code>secureSsl</code> set to true. In this case, implementations MAY chose to make accessing a site with bad HTTPS configurations cause a <code>WebDriverException</code> to be thrown. If this is the case, the <code>Capabilities</code> describing the session MUST also set the <code>secureSsl</code> capability to "true".

    <p>The ordering of the keys is not defined, but SHOULD be determined by iterating over each top level browser window and returning the tabs within that window before iterating over the tabs of the next top level browser window. For example, in the diagram below, the window handles should be returned as the handles for: win1tab1, win1tab2, win2.</p>

    <h2>Scaling the Content of Windows</h2>

<section>
<h2>Where Commands Are Handled</h2>
  
<p>Web applications can be composed of multiple windows and/or frames. For a normal user, the context in which an operation is performed is obvious: it's the window or frame that currently has OS focus and which has just received user input. The WebDriver API does not follow this convention. There is an expectation that many browsers using the WebDriver API may be used at the same time on the same machine. This section describes how WebDriver tracks which window or frame is currently the context in which commands are being executed.</p>
    
<section>
<h2>Default Content</h2>

<p>WebDriver's <dfn>default context</dfn> is the equivalent of <code>window.top</code>.</p>

<h2>Switching Windows</h2>

<table>

		<td>Command Name</td>
		<td>switchToWindow</td>

	<tr>
		<td>Parameters</td>
		<td>"sessionId" {string} The key that identifies which session this request is for.<br/>
		    "name" {string} The identifier used for a window.</td>

	    <td>None</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>Errors</td>
	    <td>NoSuchWindowException if no matching window can be found</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The "switchToWindow" command is used to select which window should currently be accepting commands. In order to determine which window should be used for accepting commands, the "switchToWindow" command will iterate over all windows. For each window, the following will be compared --- in this order --- with the "name" parameter:
    
    <ol>
        <li>A window handle, obtained from "getWindowHandles" or "getWindowHandle".</li>
        <li>The window name, as defined when the window was opened (the value of "window.name")</li>
        <li>The "id" attribute of the window.</li>
    </ol>

<p>If no windows match, then a "NoSuchWindowException" MUST be thrown, otherwise the "default content" of the first window to match will be selected for accepting commands.</p>

<p>When a new browser session is started by WebDriver and only a single window is present then the default content of that window becomes the "current" window. When more than one window is opened, the "current" window is undefined. Any commands that are executed at this point that require a window MUST throw an exception (<strong>TODO: Which exception? Ideally the same as if a window had just been closed</strong>). The correct way for a user to recover from this situation is to obtain the list of window handles and to "switch to" one of these.</p>

<h2>Switching Frames</h2>

<p>The "switchToFrame" command is used to select which frame within a window should be used for handling future commands. All frame switching is taken from the current context from which commands are currently being handled. The "id" parameter can be one of a string, number of an element. WebDriver implementations MUST determine which frame to select using the following algorithm:

<ol>
    <li>If the "id" is a number the current context is set to the equivalent of the JS expression "window.frames[n]" where "n" is the number and "window" is the DOM window represented by the current context.</li>
    <li>If the "id" is null, the current context is set to the default context.</li>
    <li>If the "id" is a string:
        <ol>
            <li>If the JS expression "window.frames[id]" evaluated in the current context returns a window, where "id" is the value of the the "id" parameter, the current context is set to that.</li>
            <li>Otherwise for each value of "window.frames" (referred to as "window"):
                <ol>
                    <li>If "window" has a "name" property or attribute equal to the "id" parameter, this becomes the current context.</li>
                    <li>If "window" has an "id" property or attribute equal to the "id" parameter, this becomes the current context.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>If the "id" represents a WebElement, and the corresponding DOM element represents a FRAME or an IFRAME, and the WebElement is part of the current context, the "window" property of that DOM element becomes the current context.</li>
</ol>

<p>In all cases if no match is made a "NoSuchFrameException" MUST be thrown.</p>

<p>Frame switching MUST succeed even if doing so would cross a security origin, or javascript executing in window.top's context would otherwise not be able to access the frame being switched to.</p>

  <h2>Running Without Window Focus</h2>
  <p>All browsers must comply with the <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#focus">focus</a> section of
  the [[!HTML5]] spec. In particular, the requirement that the element within a top-level browsing
  context be independent of whether or not the top-level browsing context itself
  has system focus MUST be followed.</p>

  <p class="note">This requirement is put in place to allow efficient machine
  utilization when using the WebDriver API to control several browsers
  independently on the same desktop</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Elements</h2>
  <p>One of the key abstractions of the WebDriver API is the 
  <a>WebElement</a> interface. Each instance of this interface represents an 
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-dom-20120105/#interface-element">Element</a> as defined in the
  [[!DOM4]] specification. Because the WebDriver API is designed to allow users to interact with apps as if
  they were actual users, the capabilities offered by the 
  <code>WebElement</code> interface are somewhat different from those offered by the DOM Element interface.</p>

  <p>Each WebElement instance must have an ID, which is distinct from the value
  of the DOM Element's "id" property. The ID for every WebElement representing the same
  underlying DOM Element must be the same. The IDs used to refer to different
  underlying DOM Elements must be unique.</p>

  <dl class="idl" title="interface WebElement">
    <dt>readonly attribute DOMString id</dt>
    <dd>The WebDriver ID of this particular element. This SHOULD be a UUID.</dd>
  </dl>

  <div class="note">
    <p>This requirement around WebElement IDs allows for efficient equality
    checks when the WebDriver API is being used out of process.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This section of the specification covers finding elements. Later sections deal with querying and interacting with
  these located elements. The primary interface used by the WebDriver API for locating elements is the 
  <code>SearchContext</code>.</p>
  <section>
    <h2>Lists of WebElements</h2>
    
    <p>The primary grouping of <a>WebElement</a> instances is an <code>array</code> of <a>WebElement</a> instances</p>
    
    <p>A reference to an WebElement is obtained via a SearchContext. The key

      requirement is not always met. Consequently, this strategy is equally
      valid for finding a single element, or groups of elements. In the case of
      finding a single WebElement, this MUST be functionally identical to a call
      to "<a

    <h2>Reading Attributes and Properties</h2>
    <p>Although the [[!HTML5]] spec is very clear about the difference between the properties and attributes of a DOM element, users are frequently confused between the two. Because of this, the WebDriver API offers a single command ("getElementAttribute") which covers the case of returning both the value of a DOM element's property or attribute. If a user wishes to refer specifically to an attribute or a property, they should evaluate Javascript in order to be unambiguous. In this section, the "attribute" with name <code>name</code> shall refer to the result of calling the Javascript "getAttribute" function on the element, with the following exceptions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If, in the current rendering mode, the content attribute <code>name</code> reflects a boolean IDL attribute, as per <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/">the HTML specification</a>, the value MUST be the string 'true' if that IDL attribute's value is true or the null value if the IDL attribute's value is false.</li>
      <li>If the element is an OPTION element and <code>name</code> is "value" and there is no "value" attribute, then the text content of the OPTION element MUST be returned, in accordance with [[!HTML401]] spec, specifically the section on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/interact/forms.html#adef-value-OPTION">pre-selected options</a>. The text content MUST be the result of calling the "getElementText" command on the OPTION element.</li>
      <li>If the element is selectable, and <code>name</code> is "selected", or the element is an INPUT element of type "checkbox" or "radio" and <code>name</code> is "checked", return the string 'true' if the element is selected, and the null value otherwise.</li>
      <li>If <code>name</code> is "style", the value returned MUST be <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#serialize-a-css-rule">serialized as defined</a> in the [[!CSSOM-VIEW]] spec. Notably, css property names MUST be cased the same as specified in in section 6.5.1 of the [[!CSSOM-VIEW]] spec.
        <ul>
          <li>Consequently, it SHOULD be equivalent to obtaining the "cssText" property, with the additional constraint that the same value MUST be returned after a round trip through "executeScript". That is, the following pseudo-code MUST be true (where "driver" is a WebDriver instance, and "element" is a WebElement):
<pre class="code">
var style = element.getAttribute('style');
driver.executeScript('arguments[0].style = arguments[1]', element, style);
var recovered = element.getAttribute('style');
assertEquals(style, recovered);
</pre>
          </li>
          <li>Color property values MUST be standardized to rgba format, matching the regular expression: <code>rgba\(\d+, \d+, \d+, (1|0(\.\d+)?)\)</code>.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li>If the value is expected to be a URL (see the below table), return the property named <code>name</code>, i.e. a fully resolved URL:
        <strong>TODO: This doesn't feel like an exhaustive list</strong>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Tag name</th>
                <th>"name" value</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>A</td>
                <td>href</td>

                <td>src</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
      </li>
      <li>If <code>name</code> is in the below table, and the above stages have not yielded a defined, non-null value, the value of the aliased attribute in the table below should be returned:
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Original property name</th>
          <th>Aliased property name</th>
        </tr>

          <td>readonly</td>
          <td>readOnly</td>
        </tr>
      </table></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">These aliases provide the commonly used names for element properties.</p>

   <h2>Rendering Text</h2>
   <p>All WebDriver implementations must support getting the <a
     href="#determining-visibility">visible</a> text of a WebElement, with excess whitespace compressed.</p>
   
<p>The following definitions are used in this section:
    <dl>
        <dt id="text.whitespace">Whitespace</dt>
        <dd>Any text that matches the ECMAScript regular expression class <code>\s</code>.
        
        <dt id="text.whitespace-nbsp">Whitespace excluding non-breaking spaces</dt>
        <dd>Any text that matches the ECMAScript regular expression <code>[^\S\xa0]</code>
            
        <dt id="text.blocklevel">Block level element</dt>
        <dd>A block-level element is one which is not a table cell, and whose effective CSS display style is not in the set ['inline', 'inline-block', 'inline-table', 'none', 'table-cell', 'table-column', 'table-column-group']</dd>
        
        <dt id="text.horizontal">Horizontal whitespace characters</dt>
        <dd>Horizontal whitespace characters are defined by the ECMAScript regular expression <code>[\x20\t\u2028\u2029]</code>.</dd>
    </dl>

<p>The expected return value is roughly what a text-only browser such as Lynx would display. The algorithm for determining this text is as follows:</p>

<p>Let <code>lines</code> equal an empty array. Then:
<ol>  
    <li><span id="text.1">For</span> each <code>child</code> of node, at time of execution, in order:
        <ol>
            <li>Get whitespace, text-transform, and then, if <code>child</code> is:
                <ul>
                    <li>a node which is not <a href="#determining-visibility">visible</a>, do nothing</li>
                    <li>a [[!DOM4]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-dom-20120105/#interface-text">text node</a> let <code>text</code> equal the <code>nodeValue</code> property of <code>child</code>. Then:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Remove any zero-width spaces (\u200b), form feeds (\f) or vertical tab feeds (\v) from <code>text</code>.</li>
                            <li>Canonicalize any recognized single newline sequence in <code>text</code> to a single newline (greedily matching <code>(\r\n|\r|\n)</code> to a single \n)</li>
                            <li>If the parent's effective CSS whitespace style is 'normal' or 'nowrap' replace each newline (\n) in <code>text</code> with a single space character (\x20). If the parent's effective CSS whitespace style is 'pre' or 'pre-wrap' replace each <a href="#text.horizontal">horizontal whitespace character</a> with a non-breaking space character (\xa0). Otherwise replace each sequence of <a href="#text.horizontal">horizontal whitespace characters</a> except non-breaking spaces (\xa0) with a single space character</li>
                            <li>Apply the parent's effective CSS text-transform style as per the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/text.html#propdef-text-transform">CSS 2.1 specification</a> ([[!CSS21]])</li>
                            <li>If <code>last(lines)</code> ends with a space character and <code>text</code> starts with a space character, trim the first character of <code>text</code>.</li>
                            <li>Append <code>text</code> to <code>last(lines)</code> in-place</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>an element which is <a href="#determining-visibility">visible</a>. If the element is a:
                        <ul>
                            <li>BR element: Push '' to <code>lines</code> and continue</li>
                            <li><a href="#text.blocklevel">Block-level</a> element and if <code>last(lines)</code> is not '', push '' to <code>lines</code>.</li>
                        </ul>
                    And then recurse depth-first to <a href="#text.1">step 1</a> with <code>child</code> set to the current element</li>
                    <li>If element is a TD element, or the effective CSS display style is 'table-cell', and last(lines) is not '', and <code>last(lines)</code> does not end with whitespace append a single space character to <code>last(lines)</code> [Note: Most innerText implementations append a \t here]</li>
                    <li>If element is a block-level element: push '' to <code>lines</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>For each line in <code>lines</code> trim any leading and trailing whitespace excluding <a href="#text.whitespace-nbsp">non-breaking space characters</a>.</li>
    <li>Let <code>s</code> be <code>lines.join('\n')</code></li>
    <li>Trim any leading and trailing <a href="#text.whitespace-nbsp">whitespace excluding non-breaking space characters</a> from <code>s</code>.</li>
    <li>Replace any non-breaking spaces (\xa0) with spaces (\x20) in <code>s</code>.</li>
    <li>Return <code>s</code>.</li>

  <h2>Executing Javascript</h2>

      Blocking seems like a reasonable idea, but there is an assumption that

      What happens to unhandled JS errors? Caused by a user's JS? Caused by JS
      on a page? How does a user of the API obtain the list of errors? Is that
      list cleared upon read?

  <h2>User Input</h2>
  <p>The WebDriver API offers two ways of interacting with elements,
  either with a set of low-level "do as I say" commands, or a
  high-level "do as I mean" set of commands. The former are offered to
  allow precise emulation of user input. The latter are offered as a
  convenience to cover the common case, and can conceivably be
  implemented on top of the lower level primitive operations.</p>

  <section>
    <h2 id="interactable">Interactable elements</h2>
    <p>Some input actions require the element to be interactable. The following conditions must be met for the element to be considered interactable:
    <ul>
      <li>The element MUST be visible, as defined in <a href="#determining-visibility">section 10.1</a>.</li>
      <li>The element MUST NOT be disabled:
      <ul>
        <li>If the currently loaded document being treated as an HTML
        4 document, the element is considered disabled if it does not support
        the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#adef-disabled">disabled</a>
        attribute (according to the [[!HTML401]] spec), or the
        disabled attribute is not set in the case where that attribute.</li>
        <li>If the currently loaded document is an HTML 5 document,
          the element is
          not <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#adef-disabled">disabled</a>
          as defined in the [[!HTML5]] spec.</li>

    <section>
      <h2>Low Level Commands</h2>
      <p>The low level commands provide a mechanism for precisely stating how a user can interact with the browser. 

    <p>User input SHOULD be emulated natively, with the input events
    being indistinguishable from those generated by a real user
    interacting with the browser. It is therefore recommended that
    input events SHOULD NOT be generated at the DOM level using the
    "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#dom-document-createevent">createEvent</a>"
    API from [[!DOM4]] or similar. Instead, emulated input events
    SHOULD originate from the browser's own event queue. This is the
    order of preference for methods to emulate user input:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Injection into the browser's event queue.</li>
      <li>Sending OS-specific input messages to the browser's window. This has the disadvantage that the browser being automated may not be properly isolated from a user accidentally modifying input device state.</li>
      <li>Use of Javascript to inject events at the DOM level.</li>
      <li>Use of the accessibility API. The disadvantage of this method is that the browser's window must be focused. As a result, multiple tests cannot run in parallel.</li>
    </ul>

        <p>TODO: Ensure that this section mentions that mouse state MUST be maintained if the page is not related and MAY be maintained if the browser navigates to a new page.</p>

    <section>
    <h2>High Level Commands</h2>
    <p>These higher level commands SHOULD be built on top of the low level commands, and implement a user friendly way of interacting with a page in a way that models common user expectations.

    <section>
    <h2>Clicking</h2>
    <dl class="idl" title="partial interface WebElement">
      <dt>void click()</dt>
      <dd>Click in the middle of the <code>WebElement</code> instance. The middle of the element is defined as the middle of the box returned by
      calling <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view/#the-getclientrects-and-getboundingclientrect-methods">getBoundingClientRect</a>
      on the underlying DOM Element, according to the [[!CSSOM-VIEW]] spec. If
      the element is outside the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#viewport">viewport</a>
      (according to the [[!CSS21]] spec), the implementation SHOULD bring the
      element into view first. The implementation MAY invoke scrollIntoView on
      the underlying DOM Element. The element MUST be visible, as defined in <a
        href="#determining-visibility">section 10.1</a>. See the note below for when the element is obscured by another element.
      Exceptions:
      <ul>
        <li>Links (A elements): Clicking happens in the middle of the first
        <a href="#determining-visibility">visible</a> bounding client rectangle. This is to overcome overflowing links where the middle of the bounding client rectangle does not actually fall on a clickable part of the link.</li>
        <li>SELECT elements without the &quot;multiple&quot; attribute set.
        Clicking on the select element SHOULD open the drop down menu. The next
        click, on any element, MUST close this menu.</li>
        <li>Clicking directly on an OPTION element (without clicking on the
        parent SELECT element previously) MUST open a selection menu, as if the
        SELECT option was clicked first, then click on the OPTION before finally
        closing the SELECT element's menu. The the SELECT menu MUST be closed
        once the action is complete.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The possible errors for this command:
      <ul>
        <li>StaleElementReference if the given element is no longer attached to the DOM.</li>
        <li>ElementNotVisible if the element is hidden and thus cannot be interacted with.</li>
        <li>MoveTargetOutOfBounds if the element cannot be scrolled into view.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This command MUST use either the mouse or touch mechanisms for
      emulating the user input. In the case where the browser being automated
      supports only mouse input or both mouse and touch input, the low-level
      mouse mechanisms MUST be used. If the browser only supports touch input,
      the low level touch inputs MUST be used.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p class="note">As the goal is to emulate users as closely as possible, the
    implementation SHOULD NOT allow clicking on elements that are obscured by
    other elements. If the implementation forbids clicking on obscured elements,
    an <code>ElementNotVisible</code> exception MUST be thrown and this SHOULD have an
    explantory message explaining the reason. The implementation SHOULD try to
    scroll the element into view, but in case it is fully obscured, it SHOULD
    NOT be clickable.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Typing keys</h2>
    <p>A requirement for key-based interaction with an element is that it is
    <a href="#interactable">interactable</a>. Typing into an element is permitted if one of the following conditions is met:
    <ul>
      <li>The element is <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#focus">focusable</a> as defined in the editing section of the [[!HTML5]] spec.</li>
      <li>The element is allowed to be the <code>activeElement</code>. In
      addition to focusable elements, this allows typing to the <code>BODY</code> element.</li>
      <li>In an HTML5 document, the element is <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#attr-contenteditable">editable</a> as a result of having its <code>contentEditable</code> attribute set or the containing document is in <code>designMode</code>.</li>
      <li>The underlying browser implementation would allow keyboard input to
      directed to the element (eg. an HTML 4 document with a DIV marked as being
      contentEditable)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Prior to any keyboard interaction, an attempt to shift focus to the
    element MUST be attempted if the element does not currently have the focus. This is the case if one of the following
    holds:
    <ul>
      <li>The element is not <code>document.activeElement</code></li>
      <li>The owner document of the element to be interacted with is not the
      focused document.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In case focusing is needed, the implementation MUST follow the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#focus-management"><b>focusing steps</b></a> as described in the focus management section of the [[!HTML5]] spec. The focus MUST NOT leave the element at the end of the interaction, other than as a result of the interaction itself (i.e. when the tab key is sent).
    </p>
    <dl class="idl" title="partial interface WebElement">
      <dt>void clear()</dt>
      <dd>Clears the value of the element.</dd>
      <dt>void sendKeys(string[] keysToSend)</dt>
      <dd>Sends a sequence of keyboard events representing the keys in the keysToSend parameter.
      <p>Caret positioning: If focusing was needed, after following the focusing steps, the caret MUST be positioned at the end of the text currently in the element. At the end of the interaction, the caret MUST be positioned at the end of the typed text sequence, unless the keys sent position it otherwise (e.g. using the LEFT key).</p>
      <p>There are four different types of keys that are emulated:
      <ul>
        <li>Character literals - lower-case symbols.</li>
        <li>Uppercase letters and symbols requiring the SHIFT key for typing.</li>
        <li>Modifier keys</li>
        <li>Special keys</li>
      </ul>The rest of this section details the values used to represent the different keys, as well as the expected behaviour for each key type.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>When emulating user input, the implementation MUST generate
    the same sequence of events that would have been produced if a real user was
    sitting in front of the keyboard and typing the sequence of characters. In
    cases where there is more than one way to type this sequence, the
    implementation MUST choose one of the valid ways. For example, typing <code>AB</code> may be achieved by:
    <ul>
      <li>Holding down the Shift key</li>
      <li>Pressing the letter 'a'</li>
      <li>Pressing the letter 'b'</li>
      <li>Releasing the Shift key</li>
    </ul>
    Alternatively, it can be achieved by:
    <ul>
      <li>Holding down the Shift key</li>
      <li>Pressing the letter 'a'</li>
      <li>Releasing the Shift key</li>
      <li>Holding down the Shift key</li>
      <li>Pressing the letter 'b'</li>
      <li>Releasing the Shift key</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Or by simply turning on the CAPS LOCK first.</p>
    <p>
    The implementation MAY use the following algorithm to generate the events.
    If the implementation is using a different algorithm, it MUST adhere to the
    requirements listed below.
    <p>For each key, <var>key</var> in <var>keysToSend</var>, do
    <ol>
      <li>If <var>key</var> is a lower-case symbol:
      <ol>
        <li>If the Shift key is not pressed:
        <ol>
          <li>Generate a sequence of key-down, key-press and key-up events with
          <var>key</var> as
          the character to emulate</li>

        </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Else if <var>key</var> is an upper-case symbol:
      <ol>
        <li>If the Shift key is not pressed:
        <ol>
          <li>Generate a key-down event of the Shift key.
          <li>Generate a sequence of key-down, key-press and key-up events with
          <var>key</var> as
          the character to emulate</li>
          <li>Generate a key-up event of the Shift key.
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>else (The Shift key is pressed)
        <ol>
          <li>Generate a sequence of key-down, key-press and key-up events with
          <var>key</var> as the character to emulate</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Else if <var>key</var> represents a modifier key:

        <li>let <var>modifier</var> be the modifier key represented by
        <var>key</var></li>
        <li>If <var>modifier</var> is currently held down:
        <ol><li>Generate a key-up event of <var>modifier</var></li></ol>
        </li>
        <li>Else:
        <ol><li>Generate a key-down event of <var>modifier</var></li></ol>
        </li>
        <li>Maintain this key state and use it to modify the input until it is
        pressed again.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Else if <var>key</var> represents the NULL key:
      <ol>
        <li>Generate key-up events of all modifier keys currently held
        down.</li>
        <li>All modifier keys are now assumed to be released.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Else if <var>key</var> represents a special key:
      <ol>
        <li>Translate <var>key</var> to the special key it represents</li>
        <li>Generate a sequence of key-down, key-press and key-up events for the special key.</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once keyboard input is complete, an implicit <var>NULL</var> key is sent unless the
    final character is the <var>NULL</var> key.</p>
    <p> <!-- Pseudo-code --></p>
    <p>Any implementation MUST comply with these requirements:
    <ul>
      <li>For uppercase letters and symbols that require the Shift key to be
      pressed, there are two options:
      <ul>
        <li>A single Shift key-down event is generated before the entire
        sequence of uppercase letters.</li>
        <li>Before each such letter or symbol, a Shift key-down event is
        generated. After each letter or symbol, a Shift key-up event is
        generated.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>A user-specified Shift press implies capitalization of all following
      characters.</li>
      <li>If a user-specified Shift press precedes uppercase letters and
      symbols, a second Shift key-down event MUST NOT be generated. In that
      case, a Shift key-up event MUST NOT be generated implicitly by the
      implementation.</li>
      <li>The <var>NULL</var> key releases all currently held down modifier keys.</li>
      <li>The state of all modifier keys must be reset at the end of each
      <code>sendKeys</code> call and the appropriate key-up events
      generated</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <!-- Algorithm paragraph --></p>
    <h3>Character types</h3>

    <p>The keys considered upper-case symbols are either defined by the current keyboard locale or are derived from the US 104 keys Windows keyboard layout, which are:
    <ul>
      <li>A - Z</li>
      <li>!$^*()+{}:?|~@#%_\" &amp; &lt; &gt;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When the user input is emulated natively (see note below), the implementation SHOULD use the current keyboard locale to determine which symbols are upper case. In all other cases, the implementation MUST use the US 104 key Windows keyboard layout to determine those symbols.</p>
    <p>The state of the physical keyboard MUST NOT affect emulated user input.</p>
    <h3>Internationalized input</h3>
    <p>Non-latin symbols: TBD</p>
    <p>Complex scripts using Input Method Editor (IME): TBD</p>
