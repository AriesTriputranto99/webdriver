<section id='abstract'>
<p>This specification defines the WebDriver API, a platform-and language-neutral interface that allows programs or scripts to introspect into, and control the behaviour of, a web browser. The WebDriver API is primarily intended to allow developers to write tests that automate a browser from a separate controlling process, but may also be implemented in such a way as to allow in-browser scripts to control a (separate?) browser.</p>

<p>The WebDriver API is defined by a set of interfaces to discover and manipulate DOM elements on a page, and to control the behaviour of the containing browser.</p>

<p>This specification also includes a non-normative reference serialisation (to JSON) of the interface's invocations and responses that may be useful for browser vendors.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The WebDriver API aims to provide a synchronous API that can be used for a variety of use cases, though
  it is primarily designed to support automated testing of web apps.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Intended Audience</h3>
    <p>This specification is intended for implementors of the WebDriver API. It is not intended as light bed
    time reading.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Relationship of WebDriver API and Existing Specifications</h3>
    <p>Where possible and appropriate, the WebDriver API references existing specifications. For example, the
    list of boolean attributes for elements is drawn from the 
    <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html">HTML5 specification</a>. When references are made, this
    specification will link to the relevant sections.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Naming the Two Sides of the API</h3>
    
    <p>The WebDriver API can be thought of as a client/server process. However, implementation details can mean that this terminology becomes confusing. For this reason, the two sides of the API are called the "local" and the "remote" ends.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Local</dt>
      <dd>The user-facing API. Command objects are sent and Response objects are consumed by the local end of the WebDriver API.</dd>
      
      <dt>Remote</dt>
      <dd>The implementation of the user-facing API. Command objects are consumed and Response objects are sent by the remote end of the WebDriver API.</dd>
      
    </dl>
    
    <p>There is no requirement that the local and remote ends be in different processes.</p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Commands and Responses</h2>
  <p>The WebDriver API is designed to be used both in-process and out-of-process. The IDL listed in Appendix
  XXXX SHOULD be used as the basis for the user-facing API. When used out-of-process, the WebDriver API
  defines command/repsonse objects that MUST be used. How these are encoded and transmitted between the browser being
  automated and the user of the API is left undefined, but a non-normative implementation of this as JSON over HTTP is
  given in appendix XXXX.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Command</h3>
    <p>A command represents a call to the remote end of the WebDriver API.</p>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface Command">
      <dt>attribute string sessionId</dt>
      <dd>A reference to the session to which this command is associated.</dd>
      <dt>attribute string name</dt>
      <dd>The name of the command to execute</dd>
      <!-- TODO: This should be a Dictionary or Map, not an object -->
      <dt>attribute object parameters</dt>
      <dd>A map of the named parameters to an object representing its value.</dd>
    </dl>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Response</h3>
    <p>A response represents the value returned from remote end of the WebDriver API.</p>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface Response">
      <dt>readonly attribute string sessionId</dt>
      <dd>A reference to the session to which this command is associated.</dd>
      <dt>readonly attribute integer status</dt>
      <dd>The status code representing the success or failure of the method. Anything other than 0 indicates a failure
      of some kind</dd>
      <dt>readonly attribute object value</dt>
      <dd>The return value of the method call. It's type is determined by the <code>Command</code> that has been executed. In the specification, each command definition will make clear what the expected return type is.</dd>
    </dl>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Processing Additional Fields on Commands and Responses</h3>
    
    <p>Any Command or Response MAY contain additional fields than those listed above. These fields MUST be maintained, unaltered by any intermediate processing nodes. There is no requirement to maintain the ordering of fields.</p>
    
    <div class="note">
      <p>This requirement exists to allow for extension of the protocol, and to allow implementors to decorate Commands and Responses with additional information, perhaps giving context to a series of messages. or providing security information.</p>
    </div>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Error Codes</h3>
    <p>The WebDriver API indicates the success or failure of a command invocation via a status code on the 
    <code>Response</code>object. The following values are used and have the following meanings.</p>
    <!-- TODO: These values are derived from existing common usage. Do they need to be reconsidered? -->

  <h2>Browser Capabilities</h2>
  <p>Different browsers support different levels of various specifications. For example, some support SVG or the CSS
  Selector API, but only browsers that implement HTML5 will support LocalStorage. The WebDriver API provides
  a mechanism to query the supported capabilities of a browser. Each broad area of functionality
  within the WebDriver API has an associated capability string. Whether a particular capability MUST or MAY
  be supported --- as well as fallback mechanisms for handling those cases where a capability is not supported --- is
  discussed where the capability string is defined.</p>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Capabilities</h3>
  <dl class="idl" title="interface Capabilities">
    <dt>readonly attribute object capabilities</dt>
    <dd>The underlying collection of capabilities, represented as a dictionary mapping strings to values which may be
    of type boolean, numerical or string.</dd>
    <dt>boolean has(string capabilityName)</dt>
    <dd>Queries the underlying <code>capabilities</code> to see whether the
    value is set. This will return true if the capabilities contain a key with
    the given <code>capabilityName</code> and the value of that key is defined.
    If the value is a boolean, this function will return that boolean value. If
    the value is "null", an empty string or a 0 then this method will return
    false.</dd>
    <dt>object get(string capabilityName)</dt>
    <dd>Get the value of the key matching capabilityName in the underlying<code>capabilities</code>or <code>null</code>if no value is defined.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>A <code>Capabilities</code> instance MUST be immutable. If a mutable <code>Capabilities</code> instance is required, then the <code>MutableCapabilities</code> MUST be used instead.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>MutableCapabilities</h3>
  <dl class="idl" title="interface MutableCapabilities : Capabilities">
    <dt>void set(string capabilityName, object value)</dt>
    <dd>Set the value of the given <code>capabilityName</code>to the given <code>value</code>. If the value is not a boolean, numerical type or a string, a <code>WebDriverException</code>should be thrown.</dd>
  </dl>
</section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Sessions</h2>
  <p>Non-normative summary: A session is equivalent to a single instantiation of a particular browser, including all
  child windows. The WebDriver API gives each session a UUID stored as a string that can be used to differentiate one
  session from another, allowing multiple browsers to be controlled on the same machine if needed, and allowing
  sessions to be routed via a multiplexer. This ID is sent with every 
  <code>Command</code>and returned with every 
  <code>Response</code>and is stored on the 
  <code>sessionId</code>field.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Creating a Session</h3>
    <p>The process for successfully creating a session follows.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The local end creates a new Capabilities or MutableCapabilities instance describing the desired capabilities
      for the session. The Capabilities object MAY be empty, but MUST be defined.</li>
      <li>The local end creates a new Command with the "name" being "newSession" and the "parameters" containing an
      entry named "desiredCapabilities" with the value set to the Capabilities instance from the previous step. The
      "sessionId" fields SHOULD be left empty.</li>
      <li>For an out of process WebDriver server, this Command is encoded and transmitted to the remote end point. For
      an in-process WebDriver server, a factory function or method is called.</li>
      <li>The remote end examines the Capabilities, and creates a new session matching as many of the Capabilities as
      possible. How the new session is created depends on the implementation of this specification. In the case of a
      browser automation framework, it is expected that a new instance of the browser is started if possible.</li>
      <li>The session must be assigned a UUID which MUST be unique for each session (by definition). Generating the UUID
      MAY occur before the session is created. If the Command object had the "sessionId" field set, this MAY be
      discarded in favour of the freshly generated UUID. Because of this, it is
      recommanded that UUID generation be done on the remote end.</li>
      <li>The remote end create a new Response object. 
      <ul>
        <li>The "sessionId" field is assigned the UUID associated with this session.</li>
        <li>The session is described by filling a Capabilities instance with keys matching the parts of this
        specification that can be fulfilled. This is assigned to the "value" field of the Response. This fields MUST
        be filled</li>
        <li>The "status" field is set to "0"</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>The Response is transmitted or returned back to the local end.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There is no requirement for the local end to validate that some or all of the fields sent on the Capabilities
    associated with the Command match those returned in the Response.</p>
    <section>
      <h3>Capability Names</h3>
      <p>The following keys are to be used in the Capabilities instances.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>browserName</dt>
        <dd>The name of the desired browser as a string</dd>
        <dt>version</dt>
        <dd>The version number of the browser, given as a string</dd>
        <dt>platform</dt>
        <dd>The OS that the browser is running on, matching any of the platform names given below.</dd>
        <dt>platformVersion</dt>
        <dd>The version of the OS that the browser is running on as a string.</dd>
      </dl>

      <section>
        <h3>Platform Names</h3>
        <p>These are named in the style of enums in C-like languages.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ANDROID</li>
          <li>LINUX</li>
          <li>MAC</li>
          <li>UNIX</li>
          <li>WINDOWS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition "ANY" may be used to indicate the underlying OS is either unknown or does not matter.
        Implementors MAY add additional platform names.</p>

        <!-- TODO: Add section on comparing platforms -->

      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Error Handling</h3>
      <p>The following status codes will be returned by the "newSession" command. Please consult the table in the
      "commands" section for numerical values:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Success</dt>
        <dd>The session was successfully created. The "value" field of the Response contains a Capabilities object
        describing the session</dd>
        <dt>Timeout</dt>
        <dd>The new session could not be created within the time allowed for command execution on the remote end. This
        time MAY be infinite. The "value" field of the Response SHOULD contain a string explaining that a timeout has
        occurred, but it MAY be left empty or filled with the empty string.</dd>
        <dt>UnknownError</dt>
        <dd>An unhandled error of some sort has occurred. The "value" field of the Response contains a more detailed
        description of the error.</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Remote End Matching of Capabilities</h3>
      <p>This section is non-normative.</p>
      <p>The suggested order for comparing keys in the Capabilities instance when creating a session is:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>browserName</li>
        <li>version</li>
        <li>platform</li>
        <li>platformVersion</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For all comparisons, if the key is missing, that particular criteria shall not factor into the
      comparison.</p>
    </section>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Navigation</h2>
  
  <p>
  <p>get() and history navigation. The discussion of "get" will
  need to be pretty precise about when the method returns,
  including the common case of switching to "about:blank" when
  opening a new tab.</p>

  <p>This section will also need to deal with handling self-signed
  SSL certificates.</p>

  <p>WebDriver implementations MUST support navigating between
  domains.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>Detecting When to Proceed</h3>

    <p>This entire section is non-normative for now, and should be considered a
    placeholder for future discussion.</p>

    <p>Upon receiving a Command, the remote end SHOULD not execute that Command
    until the current frame has "loaded". This can be detected in a number of
    ways:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Conservative</dt>
      <dd>The remote end waits until all frames and iframes in the window
      containing an HTML document are at "document.readyState == 'complete'" and
      there are no outstanding HTTP requests, other than those caused by an
      XMLHTTPRequest. If a frame does not contain an HTML document, the remote
      end waits until all HTTP traffic to that frame is complete.</dd>

      <dt>Normal</dt>
      <dd>The remote ends waits until the current frame reaches
      "document.readyState == 'complete'" or there are no more outstanding
      network requests.</dd>

      <dt>Eager</dt>
      <dd>The remote end waits until the currrent frame reaches
      "document.readyState == 'interactive' || document.readyState ==
      'complete'" or there are no more outstanding network requests.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Unless the user specificies otherwise, the "Normal" page load detection
    mechanism must be used.</p>

  </section>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Controlling Windows</h2>

<section>
	<h2>Defining "window" and "frame"</h2>
	
	<p>Within this specification, a window equates to anything that would be referred to as "window.top" in javascript. Put another way, within this spec browser tabs are counted as separate windows.</p>

	<p><strong>TODO: define "frame"</strong></p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Window Handles</h2>
	
	<p>Each window has a "window handle" associated with it. This is an opaque string which is unique to the window. The suggested implementation is as a UUID. The "getWindowHandle" command can be used to obtain the window handle for the window that commands are currently acting upon:</p>
	
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>Command Name</td>
			<td>getWindowHandle</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Parameters</td>
			<td>"sessionId" {string} The key that identifies which session this request is for.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td>Return Value</td>
		    <td>string</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Iterating Over Windows</h2>
	
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>Command Name</td>
			<td>getWindowHandles</td>
		</tr>

	<p>This array of returned strings MUST contain a handle for every window associated with the browser session and no others. In addition, at the time of collecting the window handles the javascript expression "window.top.closed" MUST evaluate to false.</p>
	    
	<p>The ordering of the keys is not defined, but SHOULD be determined by iterating over each top level browser window and returning the tabs within that window before iterating over the tabs of the next top level browser window. For example, in the diagram below, the window handles should be returned as the handles for: win1tab1, win1tab2, win2.</p>

    <p>The close command closes the window that commands are currently being sent to. If this means that a call to get the list of window handles returns an empty list, then this close command MUST be the equivalent of calling "quit". In all other cases, control MUST be returned to the calling process once the window has been closed or an alert is displayed by the closing window.</p>
    
    <p>Once the window has closed, future commands MUST return an error (TODO: Which error?) until a new window is selected for receiving commands.</p>

    	</tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>Both of these commands accept the window handles returned by "getWindowHandles" and "getWindowHandle". In addition, the window handle may be "current", in which case the window that commands are currently being handled by MUST be acted upon.</p>
    
    <p>The "width" and "height" values refer to the "window.outerheight" and "window.outerwidth" properties. For those browsers that do not support these properties, these represent the height and width of the whole browser window including window chrome and window resizing borders/handles.</p>

  <h2>Running Without Window Focus</h2>
  <p>All browsers must comply with the <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#focus">focus</a> section of
  the [[!HTML5]] spec. In particular, the requirement that the element within a top-level browsing
  context be independent of whether or not the top-level browsing context itself
  has system focus MUST be followed.</p>

  <p class="note">This requirement is put in place to allow efficient machine
  utilization when using the WebDriver API to control several browsers
  independently on the same desktop</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Elements</h2>
  <p>One of the key abstractions of the WebDriver API is the 
  <code>WebElement</code> interface. Each instance of this interface represents an 
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/core.html#ID-745549614">Element</a>as defined in the
  [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-CORE]] specification. Because the WebDriver API is designed to allow users to interact with apps as if
  they were actual users, the capabilities offered by the 
  <code>WebElement</code> interface are somewhat different from those offered by the DOM Element interface.</p>

  <p>Each WebElement instance must have an ID, which is distinct from the value
  of the DOM Element's "id" property. The ID for every WebElement representing the same
  underlying DOM Element must be the same. The IDs used to refer to different
  underlying DOM Elements must be unique.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <p>This requirement around WebElement IDs allows for efficient equality
    checks when the WebDriver API is being used out of process.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This section of the specification covers finding elements. Later sections deal with querying and interacting with
  these located elements. The primary interface used by the WebDriver API for locating elements is the 
  <code>SearchContext</code>.</p>
  <section>
    <h2>Lists of WebElements</h2>
    
    <p>The primary grouping of <code>WebElement</code> instances is the WebElementList:</p>
    
    <dl class="idl" title="interface WebElementList">
      <dt>readonly attribute unsigned long length</dt>
      <dd>The number of <code>WebElement</code> instances represented by this list.</dd>
      <dt>getter WebElement item(in unsigned long index)</dt>
      <dd>Retrieve the <code>WebElement</code> at the given 0-based index in the collection. If there is no WebElement at this location, <code>null</code> must be returned.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <div class="note">
      <p>Implementations of this interface in other languages MAY implement this as an indexed, ordered collection native to that language. For example, in Python the WebElementList might be implemented as an native "list". In C# or Java, a "List&lt;WebElement&gt;" would be an acceptable implementation. In this case, the WebElementList interface is optional, and the operations for determining length and returning WebElements may be replaced with native accessors.</p>
    </div>

    <p>A reference to an WebElement is obtained via a SearchContext. The key
    interfaces are:</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface Locator">
      <dt>readonly attribute DOMString strategy</dt>
      <dd>The name of the strategy that should be used to locate elements.</dd>
      <dt>readonly attribute DOMString value</dt>
      <dd>The value to pass to the element finding strategy</dd>
    </dl>
  </section>
  <section>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface SeachContext">
      <dt>caller getter WebElementList findElements(in Locator locator)</dt>
      <dd></dd>
      <dt>called getter WebElement findElement(in Locator locator)</dt>
      <dd></dd>
    </dl>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Element Location Strategies</h2>
    <section>
      <h2>XPath</h2>
      <p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support finding elements by XPath 1.0 [[!XPATH]] with the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#interactions-with-xpath-and-xslt">edits from section 3.3</a> of the [[!HTML5]] specification made. If no native support is present in the browser, a pure JS implementation MAY be used. When called, the returned values MUST be equivalent of calling "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-XPath/xpath.html#XPathEvaluator-evaluate">evaluate</a>" function from the DOM Level 3 XPath spec [[DOM-LEVEL-3-XPATH]] with the result type set to "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-XPath/xpath.html#XPathResult-ORDERED-NODE-SNAPSHOT-TYPE">ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE</a> (7).</p>

    <h2>ECMAScript</h2>

          <th>Capability Name</th>
          <th>Type</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>cssSelectorsEnabled</td>
          <td>boolean</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>If a browser supports the 
      <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/selectors-api/">CSS Selectors API</a>it MUST support locating elements by
      CSS Selector. If the browser does not support the browser CSS Selector spec it MAY chose to implement locating
      by this mechanism.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Element ID</h2>
      <p>This strategy MUST be supported by all WebDriver implementations.</p>
      <p>The HTML5 specification ([[!HTML5]]) states that <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/elements.html#the-id-attribute">element IDs must be unique within their home subtree</a>. Sadly, this uniqueness requirement is not always met. Consequently, this strategy is equally valid for finding a single element, or groups of elements. In the case of finding a single WebElement, this MUST be functionally identical to a call to "<a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#dom-document-getelementbyid">document.getElementById()</a>" from the Web DOM Core specification ([[!DOM-LEVEL-3-CORE]]). When finding multiple elements, this is equivalent to an XPath query of "<tt>//*[@id = 'value']</tt>" where "value" is the ID being searched for with all "'" characters being properly escaped..</p>
