<section id="abstract">
<p>This specification defines the WebDriver API, a platform and language-neutral interface and associated wire protocol that allows programs or scripts to introspect into, and control the behaviour of, a web browser. The WebDriver API is primarily intended to allow developers to write tests that automate a browser from a separate controlling process, but may also be implemented in such a way as to allow in-browser scripts to control a &mdash; possibly separate &mdash; browser.</p>

<p>The WebDriver API is defined by a wire protocol and a set of interfaces to discover and manipulate DOM elements on a page, and to control the behaviour of the containing browser.</p>

<p>This specification also includes a normative reference serialisation (to JSON over HTTP) of the interface's invocations and responses that are to be used by browser vendors to ensure interoperability.</p>
</section>

<p>If you wish to make comments regarding this document, please email feedback to <a href="mailto:public-browser-tools-testing@w3.org">public-browser-tools-testing@w3.org</a>. All feedback is welcome, and the editors will read and consider all feedback.</p>

<p>This specification is still under active development and may not be stable. Any implementors who are not actively participating in the preparation of this specification may find unexpected changes occurring. It is suggested that any implementors join the WG for this specification. Despite not being stable, it should be noted that this specification is strongly based on an existing Open Source project &mdash; <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/">Selenium WebDriver</a> &mdash; and the existing implementations of the API defined within that project.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The WebDriver API aims to provide a synchronous API that can be used for a variety of use cases, though
  it is primarily designed to support automated testing of web apps.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Intended Audience</h3>
    <p>This specification is intended for implementors of the WebDriver API. It is not intended as light bed
    time reading.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Relationship of WebDriver API and Existing Specifications</h3>
    <p>Where possible and appropriate, the WebDriver API references existing specifications. For example, the
    list of boolean attributes for elements is drawn from the
    <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html">HTML specification</a>. When references are made, this
    specification will link to the relevant sections.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Naming the Two Sides of the API</h3>

    <p>The WebDriver API can be thought of as a client/server process. However, implementation details can mean that this terminology becomes confusing. For this reason, the two sides of the API are called the "local" and the "remote" ends.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><dfn id="local-end">Local</dfn></dt>
      <dd>The user-facing API. <code><a href="#command-1">Command</a></code> objects are sent and <code><a href="#response">Response</a></code> objects are
      consumed by the local end of the WebDriver API. It can be thought of as
      being "local" to the user of the API.</dd>

      <dt><dfn id="remote-end">Remote</dfn></dt>
      <dd>The implementation of the user-facing API. <code><a href="#command-1">Command</a></code> objects are
      consumed and <code><a href="#response">Response</a></code> objects are sent by the remote end of the WebDriver
      API. The implementation of the remote end may be on a machine remote from
      the user of the local end.</dd>

    </dl>

    <p>There is no requirement that the local and remote ends be in different processes. The IDLs given in this specification SHOULD be used as the basis for any conforming local end implementation.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Conformance Requirements</h3>

    <p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>

    <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in [[!RFC2119]]. The key word "OPTIONALLY" in the normative parts of this document is to be interpreted with the same normative meaning as "MAY" and "OPTIONAL".</p>

    <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent.</p>

    <p>The IDL fragments in this specification must be interpreted as required for conforming IDL fragments, as described in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]].</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Conformance Classes</h3>

      <p>This specification describes the conformance criteria for both local (relevant to creating bindings for languages) and remote end implementations (relevant to browser vendors and server implementors). A final conformance class &mdash; <dfn id="intermediate-node">intermediate node</dfn> &mdash; is also specified. These represent those nodes situated between the local and remote ends.</p>
    </section>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Commands and Responses</h2>
  <p>The communication between the remote and local ends is performed via Command and Response objects. How these are encoded and transmitted between the remote and local ends is left undefined.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>Command</h3>

<pre class="IDL">interface <dfn id="command" title="command">Command</dfn> {
  attribute DOMString? <code><a href="#command-name">name</a></code>;
  attribute object <code><a href="#command-parameters">parameters</a></code>;
  attribute DOMString? <code><a href="#sessionid">sessionId</a></code>;
};
</pre>

    <p>A command represents a call to a remote end to the <a href="#sessions">session</a> identified by the <code><a href="#sessionid">sessionId</a></code> attribute. By default, the <code><a href="#sessionid">sessionId</a></code> is null. The only time the null value is a valid <code><a href="#sessionid">sessionId</a></code> is before a call to <code><a href="#creating-a-session">newSession</a></code>. The name of the command to execute is held in the <dfn id="command-name" title="command-name">name</dfn>, and this MUST be handled case-sensitively. It defaults to the null value. The <dfn id="command-parameters" title="command-parameters">parameters</dfn> attribute is a map of named parameters to objects representing the value of the parameter. The default value is an empty array and this field MUST NOT be null.</p>

  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Response</h3>

<pre class="IDL">interface <dfn id="response" title="response">Response</dfn> {
  readonly attribute DOMString <code><a href="#sessionid">sessionId</a></code>;
  readonly attribute DOMString <code><a href="#response-status">status</a></code>;
  readonly attribute object? <code><a href="#response-value">value</a></code>;
};
</pre>

    <p>A Response represents the value returned from the remote end of the WebDriver API after executing a Command from the session identified by the <code><a href="#sessionid">sessionId</a></code> attribute. The default value for the <code><a href="#sessionid">sessionId</a></code> MUST be the <code><a href="#sessionid">sessionId</a></code> used in the <a>command</a></code> that this is a response to, unless the <a>command</a>'s <code><a href="#sessionid">sessionId</a></code> was the null value, in which case a unique <code><a href="#sessionid">sessionId</a></code> MUST be assigned (see <code><a href="#creating-a-session">newSession</a></code> for how this is achieved).</p>

    <p>Each Response has a <code><dfn id="response-status" title="response-status">status</dfn></code> that indicates the success or failure of the method. Anything other than "<code><a href="#status-success">success</a></code>" indicates a failure. Each command lists the status strings it can return in the section of this specification in which it is defined, but the normative list of expected statuses is given below in the <a href="#status-codes">Status Codes</a> section. This list MAY be extended by implementors of the specification, provided they follow the guidelines about <a href="#extending-the-protocol">extending the protocol</a>.</p>

    <p>The meat of the <code><a href="#response">Response</a></code> is in the <code><dfn id="response-value" title="response-value">value</dfn></code> attribute. It's type is determined by the <a>command</a></code> that has been executed. In this specification, each command definition will make clear what the expected return type is. The default value is the null value. In the case where the status indicates failure, the value is commonly the error text explaining the cause of the problem.</p>

    <p class="note">In the case where a failure is indicated and the language used for implementing the local end supports throwing exceptions, the value is often used as the exception's message.</p>

    <p>There is no requirement that implementations of <a>command</a> and <code><a href="#response">Response</a></code> exhibit any behaviour: they MAY be simple data structures. Reading of values MUST be idempotent, and writing any particular value MUST NOT cause any other values on the <a>command</a> or <code><a href="#response">Response</a></code> to change.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Processing Additional Fields on Commands and Responses</h3>

    <p>Any <a>command</a> or <code><a href="#response">Response</a></code> MAY contain additional fields than those listed above. The content of fields MUST be maintained, unaltered by any <a href="#intermediate-node">intermediate nodes</a>. There is no requirement to maintain the ordering of fields.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>This requirement exists to allow for extension of the protocol, and to allow implementors to decorate Commands and Responses with additional information, perhaps giving context to a series of messages or providing security information.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Status Codes</h3>
    <p>The WebDriver API indicates the success or failure of a command invocation via <code><a href="#response-status">Response.status</a></code>. The following values are used and have the following meanings.</p>

    <table class="simple">
      <tr>
        <th>Status Code</th>

    <section>
    <h2>Handling of Status Codes at the Local End</h2>

    <p>Status codes are returned from the <a href="#remote-end">remote end</a> to the <a href="#local-end">local end</a>. The <a href="#local-end">local end</a> SHOULD convert these into a form appropriate for the implementation language. For example, in C the status codes might be converted to constant integer values, whereas in Java various exceptions could be thrown.</p>

    <p>Implementations of the <a href="#local-end">local end</a> written in languages that support exceptions SHOULD make use of an exception hierarchy rooted on a <code>WebDriverException</code> (or similarly named base exception class). Where references to <code>WebDriverException</code> are made in this specification, we are referring to this local end conversion of status codes to local end exceptions.</p>

    <p class="note">The reason for this is to allow users of the local end to easily handle the all expected failure modes of a local WebDriver implementation by catching the <code>WebDriverException</code>.</p>

     <p class="note">It is strongly recommended that the <code>WebDriverException</code> contain as much diagnostic information as possible, including version numbers and details about the remote end. This is because experience suggests that when reporting errors from tests using WebDriver, users will simply cut-and-paste a stack trace of an exception. Adding this information to the exception makes the task of debugging problems considerably easier.</p>
  </section>

<section>
<h3>The JSON Wire Protocol</h3>

<p>Although the encoding and transport mechanism is left undefined in this specification, implementors of the remote end MUST provide an implementation suitable for acting as the server-side of the JSON and HTTP protocol (the "JSON Wire Protocol") defined in this specification and summarized non-normatively in <a href="#mapping-to-http-and-json">Appendix G</a>. This MAY take the form of a standalone executable that translates the JSON over HTTP protocol to the encoding and transport mechanism used by the remote end.</p>

<p>When describing the URL to use for each <code>Command</code> this specification will use URI paths encoded using the scheme described in [[!URI-TEMPLATE]]. The following substitutions are commonly made:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>{sessionId}</dt>
  <dd>The <code>sessionId</code> of the selected session.</dd>

  <dt>{id}</dt>
  <dd>The <code>id</code> of the <code>WebElement</code> instance being referred to</dd>
</dl>

<p>The URLs given in this specification MUST have the same path prefix. Implementations are free to redirect those as necessary.</p>

<p class="note">The reason for doing this is to reduce the complexity of local-end implementations. They need only append the path to a base URL in order to create a working implementation.</p>

<section>
<h3>JSON Encoding of Commands</h3>

A <code>Command</code> instance MUST be encoded using UTF-8 and MUST be mapped to the following JSON structure:

<!-- TODO: Is there an approved standard way of unambiguously defining JSON structures? That the W3C allows us to use in specs -->
<pre>
  {
    "sessionId" : "string value",
    "name" : "string value",
    "parameters" : {}
  }
</pre>

<p>The "<code>parameters</code>" fields depends on the "<code>name</code>" of the <code>Command</code>, and will be documented by the definition of each <code>Command</code> in this specification.

<h3>JSON Encoding of Responses</h3>

<p>A <code>Response</code> instance MUST be encoded using UTF-8 and MUST be mapped to the following JSON structure:

<pre>
  {
    "sessionId" : "string value",
    "status": "string value",
    "value" : {}
  }
</pre>

<p>The value of the "<code>value</code>" field will be defined beside each <code>Command</code> in this specification.

</section>

</section>

</section>
<section>
  <h2>Browser Capabilities</h2>
  <p>Different browsers support different levels of various specifications. For example, some support SVG or the [[!SELECTORS-API]], but only browsers that implement [[WEBSTORAGE]] will support <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-webstorage-20090910/#the-localstorage-attribute">LocalStorage</a>. The WebDriver API provides a mechanism to query the supported capabilities of a browser. Each broad area of functionality within the WebDriver API has an associated capability string. Whether a particular capability MUST or MAY be supported &mdash; as well as fallback mechanisms for handling those cases where a capability is not supported &mdash; is discussed where the capability string is defined.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>Capabilities</h3>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface Capabilities">
      <dt>readonly attribute dictionary capabilities</dt>
      <dd>The underlying collection of capabilities, represented as a dictionary mapping strings to values which may be
      of type <code>boolean</code>, <code>numerical</code> or <code>DOMString</code>. The default value is an empty dictionary.</dd>
      <dt>boolean has(DOMString capabilityName)</dt>
      <dd>Queries the underlying <code>capabilities</code> to see whether the
      value is set. This MUST return true if the capabilities contain a key with
      the given <code>capabilityName</code> and the value of that key is defined.
      If the value is a boolean, this function MUST return that boolean value. If
      the value is <code>null</code>, an empty string or a 0 then this method MUST return
      false.</dd>
      <dt>(DOMString or boolean or long)? get(DOMString capabilityName)</dt>
      <dd>Get the value of the key matching capabilityName in the underlying <code>capabilities</code> or <code>null</code> if no value is  defined.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>A <code>Capabilities</code> instance MUST be immutable.

    <p class="note">The "has" method is designed to provide a quick boolean check on whether or not a particular capability is set and can be used in an "if" statement in many languages. The "get" method returns the exact value. In the case of boolean values, this will be the same result as if "truthy" values are used (that is: <code>get('falseValue')</code> and <code>get('unsetValue')</code> are both false).</p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Sessions</h2>
  <p>Non-normative summary: A session is equivalent to a single instantiation of a particular browser, including all
  child windows. The WebDriver API gives each session a unique ID stored as an opaque string that can be used to differentiate one
  session from another, allowing multiple browsers to be controlled on the same machine if needed, and allowing
  sessions to be routed via a multiplexer. This ID is sent with every <code><a>Command</a></code> and returned with every
  <code><a>Response</a></code> and is stored on the <dfn id="sessionid" title="sessionid">sessionId</dfn> field.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Creating a Session</h3>
    <p>The process for successfully creating a session MUST be:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The local end creates a new <a>Capabilities</a> instance describing the desired capabilities
      for the session. The <a>Capabilities</a> object MUST be defined but MAY be empty.</li>
      <li>The local end MUST create a new <a>Command</a> with the "name" being "newSession" and the "parameters" containing an
      entry named "desiredCapabilities" with the value set to the <a>Capabilities</a> instance from the previous step. An optional
      "requiredCapabilities" entry MAY also be created and populated with a <a>Capabilities</a> instance. The "sessionId" fields
      SHOULD be left empty.</li>
      <li>The <a>Command</a> is transmitted to the remote end.</li>
      <li>The remote end MUST examine the "requiredCapabilities" parameter if specified, SHOULD examine the "desiredCapabilities" parameter, and MUST create a new session matching as many of the <a>Capabilities</a> as
      possible.
      How the new session is created depends on the implementation of this specification.
        <ul>
          <li>If any of the "requiredCapabilities" cannot be fulfilled by the new session, the remote end MUST quit the session and return the
            <code><a href="#status-session-not-created">session not created</a></code> error code. The sessionId of the <a>Response</a> object MUST be left as the default value unless the <a>Command</a> had the sessionId set, in which case that value MUST be used. The error message SHOULD list all unmet required capabilities though only a single required capability MUST be given.</li>
          <li>If a capability is listed in both the requiredCapabilities and desiredCapabilities, the value in the requiredCapabilities MUST be used.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The session MUST be assigned a <code><a href="#sessionid">sessionId</a></code> which MUST be unique for each session (a UUID SHOULD be used). Generating the sessionId
      MAY occur before the session is created. If the <a>Command</a> object had the "sessionId" field set, this MAY be
      discarded in favour of the freshly generated sessionId. Because of this, it is
      recommended that sessionId generation be done on the remote end. If the sessionId has already been used, a <a>Response</a> MUST be sent with the status
      code set to <code><a href="#status-session-not-created">session not created</a></code> and the value being an explanation that the sessionId has previously been used.</li>
      <li>The remote end MUST create a new <code><a>Response</a></code> object, with the following fields MUST be set to:
      <ul>
        <li>"sessionId": the <code>sessionId</code> associated with this session.</li>
        <li name="create-session-value">"value": a <a>Capabilities</a> instance. The keys of this <a>Capabilities</a> instance MUST be the strings given in each of the supported <a>Capabilities</a> as defined in the relevant sections of this specification. Supported functionality MUST be included in this <a>Capabilities</a> instance, while unsupported functionality MAY be omitted.</li>
        <li>"status": the <code><a href="#status-success">success</a></code> error code.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>The <a>Response</a> is returned to the local end.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There is no requirement for the local end to validate that some or all of the fields sent on the <a>Capabilities</a> associated with the <a>Command</a> match those returned in the <a>Response</a>.</p>

    <p>As stated, when returning the <a href="#create-session-value">value of the <a>Response</a>, the remote end MUST include the capability names and values of all supported <a>Capabilities</a> from this specification. They MAY also include any additional capability names and values of supported <a>Capabilities</a> implemented independently of this specification. Local ends MAY choose to ignore this additional information. <a href="#intermediate-node">Intermediate nodes</a> between the local and remote ends MAY interpret the <a>Capabilities</a> being returned.</p>

    <p>If the <code>browserName</code> is given as a desired capability and omitted from the required capabilities, and the returned <code>browserName</code> value does not match the requested one, local ends SHOULD issue a warning to the user. How this warning is issued is undefined, but one implementation could be a log message. In this particular case, local ends MAY chose to change the <code><a>Response</a></code>'s status code to <code><a href="#status-session-not-created">session not created</a></code>, and modify the value to explain the cause, including the value originally returned as the <code>browserName</code> capability. If this is done, the local end MUST ensure that the remote end quits the session.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Capability Names</h3>
      <p>The following keys SHOULD be used in the <a>Capabilities</a> instances. They all default to the null string.</p>
      <dl>

        <dd>The name of the desired browser as a string.</dd>

        <dd>The version of the OS that the browser is running on as a string.</dd>
      </dl>

      <section>
        <h3>Platform Names</h3>
        <p>The following platform names are defined and MUST be used, case sensitively, for the "platformName" unless the actual platform being used is not given in this list:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>android</li>
          <li>ios</li>
          <li>linux</li>

          <li>unix</li>
          <li>windows</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition "any" MAY be used to indicate the underlying OS is either unknown or does not matter.</p>

        <p>Implementors MAY add additional platform names. Until these are standardized, these MUST follow the conventions outlined in <a href="#extending-the-protocol">extending the protocol</a> section with the exception that the vendor prefix SHOULD omit the leading "-" character.<p>

        <p class="note">For example, Mozilla's Firefox OS could be described as either "-MOZ-FIREFOXOS" or "MOZ-FIREFOX". The latter makes it easier for local ends to specify an enum of supported platforms and is therefore recommended in this case.</p>

        <dd>The session was successfully created. The "value" field of the <code><a>Response</a></code> MUST contain a <a>Capabilities</a> object describing the session.</dd>
        <dt><code><a href="#status-timeout">timeout</a></code></dt>
        <dd>The new session could not be created within the time allowed for command execution on the remote end. This
        time MAY be infinite (in which case this status won't be seen). The "value" field of the <a>Response</a> SHOULD contain a string explaining that a timeout has
        occurred, but it MAY be left as the null value or filled with the empty string.</dd>
        <dt><code><a href="#status-unknown-error">unknown error</a></code></dt>
        <dd>An unhandled error of some sort has occurred. The "value" field of the <a>Response</a> SHOULD contain a more detailed
        description of the error as a string.</dd>

      <h3>Remote End Matching of Capabilities</h3>
      <p>This section is non-normative.</p>

        <li>browserVersion</li>
        <li>platformName</li>

  <h2>Navigation</h2>
  <p>Almost all usages of the WebDriver API begin by navigating to a particular URL. This section not only describes the commands used for navigation, but also describes when commands must be processed.</p>

  <p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support navigating between different HTTP domains and between HTTPS and HTTP domains if the underlying browser supports this.</p>

  <section>
    <h2 id="page-load-strategies">Page Load Strategies</h2>

    <table class="simple">
      <tr><td>Capability Name</td><td>Type</td></tr>
      <tr><td><span id="capability-pageLoadingStrategy">pageLoadingStrategy</span></td><td>DOMString</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>It is possible to request a particular strategy be used for detecting when the next command should be processed by a remote end implementation by modifying the page load strategy that is used. The following are the expected values that MAY be used when creating a new session:</p>

    <dl title='partial interface WebDriver' class='idl'>
      <dt>const DOMString CONSERVATIVE = 'conservative'</dt>
      <dd>The remote end MUST wait until all frames and iframes in the window currently being used to process commands
      that contain an HTML document are at <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/single-page.html#current-document-readiness">document.readyState</a> equals 'complete' and there are no outstanding HTTP requests, other than those caused by XMLHttpRequests. If a frame or iframe does not contain an HTML document, the remote end SHOULD wait until all HTTP traffic to that frame is complete. Put in non-normative terms, this implies that the <code>onload</code> event has fired on every frame.</dd>

      <dt>const DOMString NORMAL = 'normal'</dt>
      <dd>The remote end MUST wait until the "<code>document.readyState</code>" of the frame currently handling commands equals "<code>complete</code>", or there are no more outstanding network requests other than XMLHttpRequests.</dd>

      <dt>const DOMString EAGER = 'eager'</dt>
      <dd>The remote end MUST wait until the "<code>document.readyState</code>" of frame currently handling equals "<code>interactive</code>" or "<code>complete</code>", or there are no more outstanding network requests.</dd>
      <dt>const DOMString NONE = 'none'</dt>
      <dd>The remote end does not do any checks to see if a page load is currently active.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support the <code>normal</code> and <code>eager</code> modes and SHOULD support the <code>conservative</code> and <code>none</code> modes. If no page loading strategy is chosen, then <code>normal</code> MUST be the default.
    In addition, implementors MAY add additional page loading strategies.</p>

    <h2>Scaling the Content of Windows</h2>

  <h2>Where Commands Are Handled</h2>

  <p>Web applications can be composed of multiple windows and/or frames. For a normal user, the context in which an operation is performed is obvious: it's the window or frame that currently has OS focus and which has just received user input. The WebDriver API does not follow this convention. There is an expectation that many browsers using the WebDriver API may be used at the same time on the same machine. This section describes how WebDriver tracks which window or frame is currently the context in which commands are being executed.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Default Content</h2>

    <p>WebDriver's <dfn id="default-content">default content</dfn> is [[!html51]]'s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context">top level browsing context</a> for the window that is currently receiving WebDriver commands.</p>

    <p>When a WebDriver instance is started and a single browser window is opened, the <a href="#default-content">default content</a> of that window is automatically selected for receiving further commands. If more than one window is opened when the session starts, then the user MUST first select which window to act upon using the <code>switchToWindow</code> command. Until the user selects a window, all commands must return a status code of <code><a href="#status-no-such-window">no such window</a></code>.</p>

          <dt>DOMString name</dt>
          <dd>The identifier used for a window</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>The "switchToWindow" command is used to select which window MUST be used as the context for processing commands. In order to determine which window should be used for accepting commands, the "switchToWindow" command MUST iterate over all windows. For each window, the following MUST be compared &mdash; in this order &mdash; with the "name" parameter:

        <ol>
          <li>A window handle, obtained from "getWindowHandles" or "getWindowHandle".</li>
          <li>The window name, as defined when the window was opened (the value of "window.name")</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If no windows match, then a "<code><a href="#status-no-such-window">no such window</a></code>" status code MUST be returned, otherwise the "<a href="#default-content">default content</a>" of the first window to match will be selected for accepting commands.</p>

        </dl>
        <p>The "switchToFrame" command is used to select which frame within a window MUST be used as the context for handling future commands. All frame switching is taken from the current context from which commands are currently being handled. The "<code>id</code>" parameter can be an unsigned short or a <a>WebElement</a>. WebDriver implementations MUST determine which frame to select using the following algorithm:

        <ol>
          <li>If the "id" is a unsigned short the current context is set to the equivalent of the JS expression "window.frames[id]" where "id" is the number and "window" is the Document window represented by the current context.</li>
          <li>If the "id" is null, the current context is set to the <a href='#default-content'>default content</a>.</li>
          <li>If the "id" represents a <a>WebElement</a>, and the corresponding Document element represents a FRAME or an IFRAME, and the <a>WebElement</a> is part of the current context, the "window" property of that Document element becomes the current context.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In all cases if no match is made a "<code><a href="#status-no-such-frame">no such frame</a></code>" status code MUST be returned.</p>

        <p>If the indicated frame exists, frame switching MUST succeed even if doing so would violate the normal security constraints in place within the Javascript sandbox.</p></dd>
      <dt>void switchToParentFrame()</dt>
      <dd>
        <table class="simple jsoncommand">

  <h2>Running Without Window Focus</h2>
  <p>All browsers must comply with the <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#focus">focus</a> section of
  the [[!html51]] spec. In particular, the requirement that the active element within a top-level browsing
  context be independent of whether or not the top-level browsing context itself
  has system focus MUST be followed.</p>

  <p class="note">This requirement is put in place to allow efficient machine
  utilization when using the WebDriver API to control several browsers
  independently on the same desktop</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Elements</h2>
  <p class="note">Conformance tests for this section can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/webdriver/">webdriver module</a> under the "element_location" folder.</p>
  <p>One of the key abstractions of the WebDriver API is the
  <a>WebElement</a> interface. Each instance of this interface represents an
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-dom-20120105/#interface-element">Element</a> as defined in the
  [[!DOM4]] specification. Because the WebDriver API is designed to allow users to interact with apps as if
  they were actual users, the capabilities offered by the
  <code>WebElement</code> interface are somewhat different from those offered by the Document Element interface.</p>

  <p>Each WebElement instance must have an ID, which is distinct from the value
  of the Document Element's "id" property. The ID for every WebElement representing the same
  underlying Document Element MUST be the same. The IDs used to refer to different
  underlying Document Elements MUST be unique within the session over the entire duration of the session.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <p>This requirement around WebElement IDs allows for efficient equality
    checks when the WebDriver API is being used out of process.</p>
  </div>

  <dl class="idl" title="interface WebElement">
    <dt>readonly attribute DOMString id</dt>
    <dd>The WebDriver ID of this particular element. This SHOULD be a UUID.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>This section of the specification covers finding elements. Later sections deal with querying and interacting with
  these located elements. The primary interface used by the WebDriver API for locating elements is the
  <a>SearchContext</a>.</p>
  <section>

    <p>The primary grouping of <a>WebElement</a> instances is a <code>sequence</code> of <a>WebElement</a> instances</p>

    <p>A reference to an WebElement is obtained via a SearchContext. The key
    interfaces are:</p>

    <h2>Element Location Strategies</h2>

    <p>All element location strategies MUST return elements in the order in which they appear in the current document.</p>
    <section>
    <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
      <p>Strategy name: css selector</p>
      <p>If a browser supports the
      <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/selectors-api/">CSS Selectors API</a> ([[!SELECTORS-API]]) it MUST support locating elements by
      CSS Selector. If the browser does not support the browser CSS Selector spec it MAY choose to implement locating
      by this mechanism. If the browser can support locating elements by CSS Selector, it MUST set the "cssSelector" capability to boolean true when responding to the <a href="#creating-a-session">"newSession" command</a>. Elements MUST be returned in the same order as if "<code>querySelectorAll</code>" had been called with the <code>Locator</code>'s <code>value</code>. Compound selectors are allowed.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>ECMAScript</h2>
      <p>Finding elements by ecmascript is covered in the <a href="#ecmascript">ecmascript part of this spec</a>.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Element ID</h2>
      <p>Strategy name: id</p>
      <p>This strategy MUST be supported by all WebDriver implementations.</p>
      <p>The HTML specification ([[!html51]]) states that <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#the-id-attribute">element
        IDs must be unique within their home subtree</a>. Sadly, this uniqueness
      requirement is not always met. Consequently, this strategy is equally
      valid for finding a single element or groups of elements. In the case of
      finding a single WebElement, this MUST be functionally identical to a call
      to "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-dom-20120105/#dom-document-getelementbyid">document.getElementById()</a>"
      from the [[!DOM4]]. When finding multiple
      elements, this is equivalent to an CSS query of "<code>#value</code>" where "value" is the ID being searched for with all "'" characters being properly escaped..</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Link Text</h2>
      <p>Strategy name: link text</p>
      <p>This strategy MUST be supported by all WebDriver implementations. </p>
      <p>This strategy MUST return all <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element">"a"</a> elements with visible text exactly and case sensitively equal to the term being searched for.</p>
      <div class="note">
	    <p>This is equivalent to:</p>
	    <pre>
		  elements = driver.find_elements(by = By.TAG_NAME, value = "a")
		  result = []
		  for element in elements:
		    text = element.text
		    if text == search_term:
		      result.append(element)
		</pre>
		<p>Where "search_term" is the link text being searched for, and "result" contains the list of elements to return.</p>
	  </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Partial Link Text</h2>
      <p>Strategy name: partial link text</p>
      <p>This strategy MUST be supported by all WebDriver implementations.</p>
      <p>This strategy is very similar to <a href="#link-text">link text</a>, but rather than matching the entire string, only a subset needs to match. That is, this MUST return all <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element">"a"</a> elements with visible text that partially or completely and case sensitively matches the term being searched for.</p>
      <div class="note">
	    <p>This is equivalent to:</p>
	    <pre>
		  elements = driver.find_elements(by = By.TAG_NAME, value = "a")
		  result = []
		  for element in elements:
		    text = element.text
		    if text.search(seach_term) != -1:
		      result.append(element)
		</pre>
		<p>Where "search_term" is the link text being searched for, and "result" contains the list of elements to return.</p>

      <h2>XPath</h2>
      <p>Strategy name: xpath</p>
      <p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support finding elements by XPath 1.0 [[!XPATH]] with the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#interactions-with-xpath-and-xslt">edits from section 3.3</a> of the [[!html51]] specification made. If no native support is present in the browser, a pure JS implementation MAY be used. When called, the returned values MUST be equivalent of calling "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-XPath/xpath.html#XPathEvaluator-evaluate">evaluate</a>" function from [[DOM-LEVEL-3-XPATH]] with the result type set to "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-XPath/xpath.html#XPathResult-ORDERED-NODE-SNAPSHOT-TYPE">ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE</a> (7).</p>

    <h2 id='determining-if-displayed'>Determining if an element is displayed</h2>
      <p>The following steps MUST be used to determine if an element is displayed to a user.</p>

        <li>The BODY element MUST be displayed irrespective of any CSS style</li>
        <li>Any INPUT elements of "type=hidden" MUST NOT be displayed.</li>
        <li>Any NOSCRIPT elements MUST NOT be displayed.</li>
        <li>OPTIONs and OPTGROUP elements MUST be displayed if and only if the enclosing select element is displayed.</li>
        <li>MAP elements are displayed if and only if the image it uses is displayed. Areas within
          a map are displayed if the enclosing MAP is displayed.</li>
        <li>If element is a [[!DOM4]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-dom-20120105/#interface-text">
          text node</a> then it MUST be displayed.</li>
        <li>The element MUST NOT be displayed if there is a [[!css3-2d-transforms]] or [[!css3-3d-transforms]]
          property that gives a negative x or y to the canvas. The User Agent MUST NOT allow negative scrolling.</li>
        <li>The element MUST NOT be displayed if that element, or any of its ancestors,
          has a <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#the-hidden-attribute'>hidden attribute</a>
          or has <code>display:none</code> in its computed CSS style.</li>
        <li>If element or at least one of its descendents have both
          <a href='http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/geometry/Overview.html#dom-domrect-domrect'>DOMRect</a>
          height and a <a href='http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/geometry/Overview.html#dom-domrect-domrect'>DOMRect</a>
          width greater than 0px, as returned by <code>element.<a href='http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom-view/#dom-element-getboundingclientrect'>getBoundingClientRect()</a>
          </code>then it MUST be displayed.</li>
        <li>The element MUST NOT be displayed if any ancestor of the element  has a fixed size, and has the CSS style with one of the following <code>overflow:hidden</code>, <code>overflow-x:hidden</code> or <code>overflow-y:hidden</code>, and the element's location as determined by <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view/#dom-range-getclientrects">getClientRects</a></code> is not within the fixed size of the parent.</li>
      </ul>

    <p class="note">
      Essentially, this attempts to model whether or not a user of the browser could possibly find a way to view the <code>WebElement</code> without resizing the browser window.

      The common usage pattern for <code>isDisplayed</code> is typically something similar to (in python):</p>

        if element.is_displayed():

        <div class="note">
          <p>This implies that <code>isDisplayed</code> MUST return true if the centre of the element could be brought into the viewport. The exception to this would be the BODY element, which is generally assumed to always be displayed by users of the WebDriver spec. It is possible to interact with elements which may not have the centre point brought into the viewport by using the <a href="#low-level-commands">low level commands</a>. This means that if any part of the element could be brought into the viewport by user action and its position could be used by low-level commands then a WebDriver implementation MAY return true.</p>

    <h2 name="attributes-and-properties">Reading Attributes and Properties</h2>
    <p>Although the [[!html51]] spec is very clear about the difference between the properties and attributes of a Document element, users are frequently confused between the two. Because of this, the WebDriver API offers a single command ("getElementAttribute") which covers the case of returning either of the value of a Document element's property or attribute. If a user wishes to refer specifically to an attribute or a property, they should evaluate Javascript in order to be unambiguous.</p>
    <dl class='idl' title='partial interface WebElement'>

        <p>The algorithm to implement this MUST be (where <code>name</code> refers to the <code>name</code> parameter of the <code>getElementAttribute</code> command):</p>

            <ul>
              <li>It SHOULD be equivalent to obtaining the "cssText" property, with the additional constraint that the same value MUST be returned after a round trip through "executeScript". That is, the following pseudo-code MUST be true (where "driver" is a WebDriver instance, and "element" is a WebElement):
<pre class="example highlight">

   <h2>Rendering Text</h2>
   <p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support getting the <a

  <dl class='idl' title='partial interface WebElement'>
    <dt>DOMString getElementText()</dt>
    <dd> <p>The following definitions are used in this section:
    <dl>
        <dt id="text.whitespace">Whitespace</dt>
        <dd>Any text that matches the ECMAScript regular expression class <code>\s</code>.

        <dt id="text.whitespace-nbsp">Whitespace excluding non-breaking spaces</dt>
        <dd>Any text that matches the ECMAScript regular expression <code>[^\S\xa0]</code>

        <dt id="text.blocklevel">Block level element</dt>
        <dd>A block-level element is one which is not a table cell, and whose effective CSS display style is not in the set ['inline', 'inline-block', 'inline-table', 'none', 'table-cell', 'table-column', 'table-column-group']</dd>

<p>The expected return value is roughly what a text-only browser would display. The algorithm for determining this text is as follows:</p>

<p>Let <code>lines</code> equal an empty array. Then:

                    <li>a node which is not <a href="#determining-if-displayed">displayed</a>, do nothing</li>

                            <li>Remove any zero-width spaces (\u200b), form feeds (\f) or vertical tab feeds (\v) from <code>text</code>.</li>
                            <li>Canonicalize any recognized single newline sequence in <code>text</code> to a single newline (greedily matching <code>(\r\n|\r|\n)</code> to a single \n)</li>
                            <li>If the parent's effective CSS whitespace style is 'normal' or 'nowrap' replace each newline (\n) in <code>text</code> with a single space character (\x20). If the parent's effective CSS whitespace style is 'pre' or 'pre-wrap' replace each <a href="#text.horizontal">horizontal whitespace character</a> with a non-breaking space character (\xa0). Otherwise replace each sequence of <a href="#text.horizontal">horizontal whitespace characters</a> except non-breaking spaces (\xa0) with a single space character</li>
                            <li>Apply the parent's effective CSS text-transform style as per the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/text.html#propdef-text-transform">CSS 2.1 specification</a> ([[!CSS21]])</li>
                            <li>If <code>last(lines)</code> ends with a space character and <code>text</code> starts with a space character, trim the first character of <code>text</code>.</li>
                            <li>Append <code>text</code> to <code>last(lines)</code> in-place</li>

                    <li>an element which is <a href="#determining-if-displayed">displayed</a>. If the element is a:

                    And then recurse depth-first to <a href="#text.1">step 1</a> at the beginning of the algorithm with descendent set to the current element</li>
                    <li>If element is a TD element, or the effective CSS display style is 'table-cell', and last(lines) is not '', and <code>last(lines)</code> does not end with whitespace append a single space character to <code>last(lines)</code> [Note: Most innerText implementations append a \t here]</li>

            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The string MUST then have the white space normalised as defined in the [[!XPATH]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/#function-normalize-space">normalize-space function</a> which is then returned.</li>

  <h2>Executing Javascript</h2>
  <div class="note">
    <p>Open questions: What happens if a user's JS triggers a modal dialog?
      Blocking seems like a reasonable idea, but there is an assumption that
      WebDriver is not threadsafe.

      What happens to unhandled JS errors? Caused by a user's JS? Caused by JS
      on a page? How does a user of the API obtain the list of errors? Is that
      list cleared upon read?

  <h2>User Input</h2>
  <p>The WebDriver API offers two ways of interacting with elements,
    either with a set of low-level "do as I say" commands, or a
    high-level "do as I mean" set of commands. The former are offered to
    allow precise emulation of user input. The latter are offered as a
    convenience to cover the common case, and can conceivably be
    implemented on top of the lower level primitive operations.</p>

  <section>
    <h2 id="interactable">Interactable elements</h2>
    <p>Some user actions require the element to be interactable. The following conditions must be met for the element to be considered interactable:
    <ul>
      <li>The element MUST be displayed, as defined in <a href="#determining-if-displayed">section 10.1</a>.</li>
      <li>The element MUST NOT be disabled. "Disabled" is defined as:
      <ul>
        <li>If the current document is being processed as an HTML document, the element MUST be considered disabled if it does not support
        the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#adef-disabled">disabled</a>
        attribute (according to the [[!html51]] spec), or if the
        disabled attribute is set in the case where that attribute is present.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Low Level Commands</h2>
      <p>The low level commands provide a mechanism for precisely stating how a user can interact with the browser.

      <p><a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#glossary-activation-trigger'>Activation triggers</a> generated by the WebDriver API User SHOULD be indistinguishable from those generated by a real user
        interacting with the browser.</p>
      <p class='note'>
        In particular, the dispatched events will have the <a href='http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-event-istrusted'>isTrusted</a> attribute set to true. The most robust way to dispatch these events is by creating them in the browser implementation itself. Sending OS-specific input messages to the browser's window has the disadvantage that the browser being automated may not be properly isolated from a user accidentally modifying input device state; use of an OS-level accessibility API has the disadvantage that the browser's window must be focused, and as a result, multiple tests cannot run in parallel.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Actions</h2>
        <p>Actions are a way of executing a chain of low-level commands to emulate a user action.
          For example, if you wish to automate a drag and drop action in a browser, you would chain
          the clickAndHoldAction, moveMouseAction and buttonReleaseAction commands together. This
          implies chaining actions together to form a user action.
        <p>The remote side will receive the actions, and execute them, returning a response to the local end once the entire
          action sequence has been performed.  Actions will be
          created by chaining the low-level commands together on either a MouseAction or TouchAction
          object. Each action's sequence MUST be sent over to the remote end
          with one call with the entire sequence in the <a href="#command-1">Command</a> when the perform()
          method is called.

This enables you to use webdriver for other tasks during a gesture. For example, if you want to hold down an element, then wait for an element to appear, then mouse over onto the new element, you can use one MouseAction chain to start the mousedown event, call perform, then call findElement, then use the same MouseAction chain to add a mousemove event to the newly found element and another event to release the button, and then call perform.

This enables you to use webdriver for other tasks during a gesture. For example, if you want to hold down an element, then wait for an element to appear, then mouse over onto the new element, you can use one TouchAction chain to start the mousedown event, call perform, then call findElement, then use the same TouchAction chain to add a mousemove event to the newly found element and another event to release the button, and then call perform.

         <h2 id='multiactions'>MultiActions</h2>
         <p>Automating gestures is different from automating mouse interactions since we can have any number of fingers simultaneously acting on the touch surface. A typical 'scroll' action requires two fingers, but it is possible that we may have multi-finger gestures, or in an extrapolated case, that more than one person will operate the same touch surface, say in the case of a competitive multiplayer game. These cases mean we must allow for any number of actions occuring simulateously. This demands a MultiAction. By having a TouchAction represent the gestures of one finger, we can perform multi-finger gestures by adding these single finger gestures together, using MultiAction:
         <dl class="idl" title="interface MultiAction">
             <dt>void add (TouchAction touchAction)</dt>
             <dd>The local end must add the <code>TouchAction</code> sequence to an array which can then be serialised when <code>perform()</code>
               is called.
               <br>
               <br>
               <dl class='parameters'>
                 <dt>TouchAction touchAction</dt>
                 <dd>A touchAction object that has been populated with the action sequence that the user would like to execute on the remote end</dd>
               </dl>
             </dd>
             <dt>void perform ()</dt>
             <dd> <p>MultiAction can take in as many TouchAction objects as needed, by using the add command. When perform is called, the remote end is responsible for executing the individual actions from each TouchAction in the right group, and in the correct order. Note, the "right group" is used to denote "in the same execution group", and is not meant to denote dispatching the events at exactly the same time. For example, to automate a gesture where one finger presses, holds and releases an element while another finger moves from one element to another:
             <p class="note">
               action1 = TouchAction()<br>
               action2 = TouchAction()<br>
               action1.press(element1).wait(5).release(element1)<br>
               action2.press(element2).move(element3).release(element3)<br>
               multi = MultiAction()<br>
               multi.add(action1).add(action2)<br>
               multi.perform()
             </p>
             In this example, the remote end will find the first actions in each action object, and will perform them as part of the same execution group. This means the first execution group will be <code>press(element1)</code> and <code>press(element2)</code>. After these events are dispatched, the remote end will will find the next execution group to perform. It will execute <code>wait(5)</code> and <code>move(element3)</code>. Then it will find the next execution group, in this case, it is just <code>release(element1)</code> and <code>release(element3)</code>. When there are no more actions to perform on any of the TouchAction objects, then perform() will return.
             <br>
             <br>
             MultiAction objects do not demand that all of its member TouchActions have the same number of actions. It is possible for one TouchAction object to have more actions than another. The perform function iterates over the actions in order, and it is possible to have only one action in an execution group like so:
             <p class="note">
               action = TouchAction()<br>
               action = TouchAction()<br>
               action.press(element1).wait(5).release(element1)<br>
               action.press(element2).release(element3)<br>
               multi = MultiAction()<br>
               multi.add(action1).add(action2)<br>
               multi.perform()
             </p>
             In this case, there will be three execution groups, the last one having only <code>release(element1)</code> in it.
             <br>
             <br>
             Note: In addition to the wait command being used to indicate how long to wait, if used without arguments, it is used to indicate that nothing should be done for one TouchAction during an execution group. For example:
             <p class="note">
               action1 = TouchAction()<br>
               action2 = TouchAction()<br>
               action1.press(element1).move(element2).release(element2)<br>
               action2.press(element3).wait().release(element3)<br>
               multi = MultiAction()<br>
               multi.add(action1).add(action2)<br>
               multi.perform()
             </p>
             Here <code>wait()</code> is used to indicate to the remote end that nothing should be done for action2 in the second execution group. So the second execution group will just be <code>move(element2)</code>, but the third group will be <code>release(element2)</code> and <code>release(element3)</code>

        <p>A requirement for key-based interaction with an element is that it is
          <a href="#interactable">interactable</a>. Typing into an element is permitted if one of the following conditions is met:
            <ul>
              <li>The element is <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#focus">focusable</a> as defined in the editing section of the [[!html51]] spec.</li>
              <li>The element is allowed to be the <code><a href='http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/editing.html#dom-document-activeelement'>activeElement</a></code>. In
              addition to focusable elements, this allows typing to the <code>BODY</code> element.</li>
              <li>In an HTML document, the element is <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#attr-contenteditable">editable</a> as a result of having its <code>contentEditable</code> attribute set or the containing document is in <code>designMode</code>.</li>
              <li>The underlying browser implementation would allow keyboard input to
              directed to the element (eg. an HTML document with a DIV marked as being
              contentEditable)</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Prior to any keyboard interaction, an attempt to shift focus to the
        element MUST be attempted if the element does not currently have the focus. This is the case if one of the following
        holds:
        <ul>
          <li>The element is not already the document's <code><a href='http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/editing.html#dom-document-activeelement'>activeElement</a></code>.</li>
          <li>The owner document of the element to be interacted with is not the focused document.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In case focusing is needed, the implementation MUST follow the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#focus-management"><b>focusing steps</b></a> as described in the focus management section of the [[!html51]] spec. The focus MUST NOT leave the element at the end of the interaction, other than as a result of the interaction itself (i.e. when the tab key is sent).
        </p>
        <dl class="idl" title="partial interface WebElement">
          <dt>void clear()</dt>
          <dd>Clears the value of the element.</dd>
          <dt>void sendKeys(string[] keysToSend)</dt>
          <dd>Sends a sequence of keyboard events representing the keys in the keysToSend parameter.
            <p>Caret positioning: If focusing was needed, after following the focusing steps, the caret MUST be positioned at the end of the text currently in the element. At the end of the interaction, the caret MUST be positioned at the end of the typed text sequence, unless the keys sent position it otherwise (e.g. using the LEFT key).</p>
            <p>There are four different types of keys that are emulated:
            <ul>
              <li>Character literals - lower-case symbols.</li>
              <li>Uppercase letters and symbols requiring the SHIFT key for typing.</li>
              <li>Modifier keys</li>
              <li>Special keys</li>
            </ul>The rest of this section details the values used to represent the different keys, as well as the expected behaviour for each key type.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>When emulating user input, the implementation MUST generate
        the same sequence of events that would have been produced if a real user was
        sitting in front of the keyboard and typing the sequence of characters. In
        cases where there is more than one way to type this sequence, the
        implementation MUST choose one of the valid ways. For example, typing <code>AB</code> may be achieved by:
        <ul>
          <li>Holding down the Shift key</li>
          <li>Pressing the letter 'a'</li>
          <li>Pressing the letter 'b'</li>
          <li>Releasing the Shift key</li>
        </ul>
        Alternatively, it can be achieved by:
        <ul>
          <li>Holding down the Shift key</li>
          <li>Pressing the letter 'a'</li>
          <li>Releasing the Shift key</li>
          <li>Holding down the Shift key</li>
          <li>Pressing the letter 'b'</li>
          <li>Releasing the Shift key</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Or by simply turning on the CAPS LOCK first.</p>
        <p>
        The implementation MAY use the following algorithm to generate the events.
        If the implementation is using a different algorithm, it MUST adhere to the
        requirements listed below.
        <p>For each key, <var>key</var> in <var>keysToSend</var>, do

  <h2>Modals</h2>
    This section describes how modal dialogs should be handled using the WebDriver API.
    <p class="note">Conformance tests for this section can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/webdriver/">webdriver module</a> under the "modals" folder.</p>
    <section>
      <h2>window.alert, window.prompt and window.confirm</h2>
      <p>When the remote end is has a modal dialog such as those produced from <code>window.alert</code>,
      <code>window.prompt</code> and <code>window.confirm</code> it should allow the interrogation of the
      dialogues as using the following interface.</p>
      <dl class="idl" title="interface Alerts">
        <dt>void dismiss()</dt>
        <dd>This will dismiss the modal. If the modal is an alert, this MUST be
          equivalent to calling <code>accept()</code> on the dialog. If no alert
           is present a <code><a href="#status-no-such-alert">no such alert error</a>
         </code> MUST be raised.</dd>
        <dt>void accept()</dt>
        <dd>This will accept the modal. If the modal is from a <code>window.prompt</code>
         it is the equivalent of clicking the OK button. If no modal is present then a
          <code><a href="#status-no-such-alert">no such alert error</a></code>
           MUST be raised.</dd>
        <dt>DOMString getText()</dt>
        <dd>This will return the text that is currently in the modal.</dd>
        <dt>void sendKeys()</dt>
        <dd>This MUST act in the same manner as in
          <a href='#widl-WebElement-sendKeys-void-stringArray-keysToSend'>sendKeys</a> to an element.
          If the modal has no means for text input it should throw a <code><a href='#status-element-not-visible'>
          Element not visible error</a></code>. If no modal is present then a <a href="#status-no-such-alert">
          no such alert error</a></code> MUST be raised.
          <dl class='parameters'>
            <dt>DOMString keysToSend</dt>
            <dd>Keys to send to the modal. If the modal has no means of acceptiing text input
             it MUST raise a <code><a href='#status-element-not-visible'>element not visible error</a></code></dd>
          </dl>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>If a modal dialog is created from a <code>onbeforeunload</code> event the remote end MUST handle the
        dialog by either using <code>accept</code> or <code>dismiss</code>. These calls should either come from
        the local end or should be handled as an unexpected modal dialog as described below.
      <p>The remote end SHOULD have a mechanism to allow unexpected modal dialogs to be closed
      to prevent the remote end from becoming unusable. The default for this should be dismiss.
      The local end SHOULD allow a capability to be set that allows the default value to be
      overridden with accept. The local end SHOULD also allow setting the default behaviour
      to wait for a command to handle the modal. If the next command does not interact with the modal
      it MUST return a <code><a href='#status-unexpected-alert-open'>Unexpected alert open</a></code> error to
      the local end.

    <section>
      <h2>Modal Windows</h2>
      <p>If a browser supports Modal Windows, as created by <code>document.showModalDialog()</code>,
        it MUST support handling of Modal Windows via the WebDriver API. Model Windows can then be
        <a href='#iterating-over-windows'>iterated</a> over in the same approach as normal windows.</p>
      <p>If <code>close()</code> is called from the local end to the parent window that has modal
      windows open then the remote end SHOULD iterate over modal dialogs closing them
      before it closes the remaining windows so that it does not block the
      future commands to the remote end</p>
    </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Screenshots</h2>
  <p>Screenshots are a powerful mechanism for providing information to users of WebDriver, particularly once a particular WebDriver instance has been disposed of. In different circumstances, users want different types of screenshot. Note that the WebDriver spec does not provide a mechanism for taking a screenshot of the entire screen.</p>

  <p>In all cases, screenshots MUST be returned as lossless PNG images encoded using Base64. Local ends MUST provide the user with access to the PNG images without requiring the user to decode the Base64. This access MUST be via at least one of a binary blob or a file.</p>

  <p>All commands within this section are implemented using the "TakesScreenshot" interface:</p>

  <dl class="idl" title="interface TakesScreenshot">
    <dt>DOMString takeScreenshot()</dt>
    <dd>Take a screenshot as determined by the CommandName and return a lossless PNG encoded using Base64.
      <p>The possible errors for this command:
      <ul>
        <li><code><a href="#unknown-error">unknown error</a></code> if the if the screenshot cannot be taken.</li>
      </ul>
      <dl class='parameters'>
        <dt>optional WebElement? element</dt>
        <dd>The ID of the WebElement on which to operate. If this argument is not populated or <code>null</code></dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <section>
    <h2>Current Window</h2>
    <table class="simple">
      <tr><th>Capability Name</th><th>Type</th></tr>
      <tr><td><span id="capability-takesScreenshot">takesScreenshot</span></td><td>boolean</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>If this capability is supported, local end MUST add the <code>TakesScreenshot</code> interface to the <code>WebDriver</code> interface.</p>

    <p>This command will take a screenshot of the current window. Implementations of the remote end SHOULD capture the entire Document, even if this would require a user to scroll the browser window. That is, the returned PNG SHOULD have the same width and height as returned by a call to <code>getSize</code> of the BODY element and MUST contain all visible content on the page, and this SHOULD be done without resizing the browser window. If the remote end is unable to capture the entire Document, then the part of the Document currently displayed in UI of the browser MUST be captured without additional chrome such as scrollbars and browser chrome.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>One way to think of capturing the entire Document is that the user has an infinitely large monitor and has resized the window to allow all content to be visible. One of those monitors would be very cool.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Nested frames MUST be sized as if the user has resized the window to the dimensions of the PNG being returned. This often means that not all potentially visible content within the nested frames is captured.</p>

    <p>Remote ends MUST NOT attempt to track changes in window size as the screenshot is being taken. In particular this means that in the case of a page that makes use of "infinite scrolling" (where an AJAX call is used to populate additional content as the user scrolls down) or in some other way resizes content as the window size is changed only the content that was originally contained in the Document when the command is executed will be captured.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Element</h2>
      <table class="simple">
        <tr><th>Capability Name</th><th>Type</th></tr>
        <tr><td><span id="capability-takeElementScreenshot">takeElementScreenshot</span></td><td>boolean</td></tr>
      </table>

  	<p>If this capability is supported, local end MUST add the <code>TakesScreenshot</code> interface to the <code>WebElement</code> interface.</p>
    <p>Remote ends SHOULD take a screenshot of the area bounded by the clientBoundingRect of the Document element represented by the <code>WebElement</code>, returning it as a Base64 encoded, lossless PNG. Local ends MUST make the PNG available directly to the user as at least one of a binary blob or a file. If the remote end cannot capture the entire clientBoundingRect, they MUST scroll as much of the element into the current browser viewport as possible and capture the maximum visible area without additional browser chrome.</p>
    <p>If the <code>WebElement</code> represents a FRAME or IFRAME element, this is equivalent of taking a screenshot of the frame's BODY element.</p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Handling non-HTML Content</h2>
  <p>Non-HTML content MUST be treated in the same manner as HTML if the Non-HTML if the browser
    creates a Document object for the content of the document. If a Document Object is not created then
    how it handled SHOULD be non-normative</p>

  <section>
    <h2>XML</h2>
    <p>This section describes XML documents as described in [[XML10]]. For XHTML documents the remote end should treat them as HTML documents
    and not have the caveats, below, applied.</p>
      <p>Since Browsers create a Document object for XML pages it is expected that we can interogate
      them as a normal HTML document however the following differences should be noted:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visibility Checks MAY be skipped since XML nodes can not be hidden and <code>isDisplayed</code> MUST return true<li>
        <li>Getting computed styles of elements MUST return an empty string</li>
        <li>Position and Size of element MUST return null for elements in the map returned</li>
        <li>Attempts to clear the node MUST return an <code><a href='#status-unsupported-operation'>unsupported operation</a></code> </li>
        <li>Attempts to send keys to a node MUST return an exception <code><a href='#status-unsupported-operation'>unsupported operation</a></code></li>
        <li><code>isEnabled</code> MUST return false</li>
        <li><code>isSelected</code> MUST return false</li>
        <li><code>submit</code> MUST return an exception <code><a href='#status-unsupported-operation'>unsupported operation</a></code></li>
      </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>SVG</h2>
    <p>This section described SVG documents in a browser as described by [[SVG2]].
    Since browsers create a Document tree for SVG documents it is expected that WebDriver
    can interrogate the Document as a normal HTML document.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Working with Accessibility APIs</h2>

    <p>Many accessibility APIs represent the UI as a series of nested nodes. It is possible to map these nodes to <code>WebElement</code> instances. In order to function properly, it is likely that additional element locating strategies will be required.</p>

    <p class="note">This is one way in which it might be possible to test mobile applications that marry a native wrapper around a series of HTML views.</p>

    <h2>Extending the Protocol</h2>
    <p></p>
    <section>
      <h3>Vendor-specific Extensions</h3>
      <p>The WebDriver protocol is designed to allow extension to meet vendor-specific needs, such as interacting with the chrome of a browser. Vendor-specific extensions are implemented by appending a prefix to the command name. This should be of the form:</p>
      <pre>
        '-' + vendor prefix + '-' + command name
      </pre>
      <p>For example: "<code>-o-open-bookmark</code>" or "<code>-moz-install-extension</code>".</p>
      <p>It is guaranteed that no command name in this or future versions of the WebDriver specification will be prefixed with a leading dash.</p>

      <div class="note">
        It is suggested that vendors use the same vendor identifier as in [[!CSS21]] (notably, section <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">4.1.2.2</a>)
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Extending the JSON/HTTP Protocol</h3>
      <p>This section is non-normative.</p>
      <p>The wire protocol (see Appendix XXX) makes use of URLs to distinguish command names. When extending the protocol by adding new URLs, vendors should use their vendor prefix without additional characters to prevent any potential clashes with other implementations. This leads to URLs of the form: <code>http://host:port/session/somekey/<b>moz</b>/extension</code>.

        <p>The local end SHOULD create a new profile when creating a new session.
          If a new profile can be created it MUST NOT copy the profile in use and
          MUST create a fresh profile. By creating a new profile the user agent will
           prevent any unexpected behaviour when the remote end is accessing content.</p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>The remote end SHOULD have a specific command line argument when starting
          the browser up if it is connecting to a browser
          (e.g. firefox.exe --webdriver ) and SHOULD have user agent configuration
           preference that is tested when the user agent starts up
        <p>When the local end creates a new session the remote end MUST limit
        connections to <code>127.0.0.1</code> IPV4 address or <code>::1</code>
        IPV6 address. This will prevent new sessions being created without having
        a specific proxy installed on the remote end.</p>
        <div class='note'>
          <p>Some devices will require the device to be placed into a 'developer' mode.
          This allows unix sockets to be forwarded on to the device while the device is
          connected to a host. An example of this is if the local end needed to go through
           a remote debugger protocol.</p>
        </div>
        <p>If any of these fail then a
        <code><a href="#status-session-not-created">session not created</a></code>
        error MUST be thrown when the local end tries to create a new session.

        <h3>Fingerprinting</h3>
        <p>The following will allow web sites to know that the user interacting
        with the content is not a real user. This can be used to prevent denial
        of service attacks.
        <p>When the user agent creates a new session it MUST add a read only property
        to <code>window.navigator.webdriver</code>. The value should be set to
        <code>true</code> when WebDriver has an active session. When WebDriver does not have
        an active session then the value is equal to <code>false</code> or the property is removed.
