<section id="abstract">
<p>This specification defines the WebDriver API, a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs or scripts to introspect into, and control the behaviour of, a web browser. The WebDriver API is primarily intended to allow developers to write tests that automate a browser from a separate controlling process, but may also be implemented in such a way as to allow in-browser scripts to control a &mdash; possibly separate &mdash; browser.</p>

<p>The WebDriver API is defined by a set of interfaces to discover and manipulate DOM elements on a page, and to control the behaviour of the containing browser.</p>

<p>This specification also includes a non-normative reference serialisation (to JSON) of the interface's invocations and responses that may be useful for browser vendors.</p>
</section>

<p>If you wish to make comments regarding this document, please email feedback to <a href="mailto:public-browser-tools-testing@w3.org">public-browser-tools-testing@w3.org</a>. All feedback is welcome, and the editors will read and consider all feedback.</p>

<p>This specification is still under active development and may not be stable. Any implementors who are not actively participating in the preparation of this specification may find unexpected changes occurring. It is suggested that any implementors join the WG for this specification. Despite not being stable, it should be noted that this specification is strongly based on an existing Open Source project &mdash; <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/">Selenium WebDriver</a> &mdash; and the existing implementations of the API defined within that project.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The WebDriver API aims to provide a synchronous API that can be used for a variety of use cases, though
  it is primarily designed to support automated testing of web apps.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Intended Audience</h3>
    <p>This specification is intended for implementors of the WebDriver API. It is not intended as light bed
    time reading.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Relationship of WebDriver API and Existing Specifications</h3>
    <p>Where possible and appropriate, the WebDriver API references existing specifications. For example, the
    list of boolean attributes for elements is drawn from the 
    <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html">HTML5 specification</a>. When references are made, this
    specification will link to the relevant sections.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Naming the Two Sides of the API</h3>
    
    <p>The WebDriver API can be thought of as a client/server process. However, implementation details can mean that this terminology becomes confusing. For this reason, the two sides of the API are called the "local" and the "remote" ends.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Local</dt>
      <dd>The user-facing API. Command objects are sent and Response objects are
      consumed by the local end of the WebDriver API. It can be thought of as
      being "local" to the user of the API.</dd>
      
      <dt>Remote</dt>
      <dd>The implementation of the user-facing API. Command objects are
      consumed and Response objects are sent by the remote end of the WebDriver
      API. The implementation of the remote end may be on a machine remote from
      the user of the local end.</dd>
      
    </dl>
    
    <p>There is no requirement that the local and remote ends be in different processes. The IDL given in this specification and summarized in Appendix XXXX SHOULD be used as the basis for any conforming local end implementation.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Conformance Requirements</h3>
    
    <p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>
    
    <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in [[!RFC2119]]. The key word "OPTIONALLY" in the normative parts of this document is to be interpreted with the same normative meaning as "MAY" and "OPTIONAL".</p>
    
    <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent.</p>

    <p>The IDL fragments in this specification must be interpreted as required for conforming IDL fragments, as described in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]].</p>
    
    <section>
      <h3>Conformance Classes</h3>
      
      <p>This specification describes the conformance criteria for both local (relevant to creating bindings for languages) and remote end implementations (relevant to browser vendors and server implementors). A final conformance class &mdash; intermediate node &mdash; is also specified. These represent those nodes situated between the local and remote ends.</p>
    </section>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Commands and Responses</h2>
  <p>The communication between the remote and local ends is performed via Command and Response objects. How these are encoded and transmitted between the remote and local ends is left undefined.</p>

	<p>Although the encoding and transport mechanism is left undefined in this specification, implementors of the remote end MUST provide an implementation suitable for acting as the server-side of the JSON and HTTP protocol defined in appendix XXXX. This MAY take the form of a standalone executable that translates the JSON over HTTP protocol to the encoding and transport mechanism used by the remote end.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>Command</h3>
    
<pre class="IDL">interface <dfn id="command" title="command">Command</dfn> {  
  attribute string <code><a href="#command-name">name</a></code>;
  attribute dictionary <code><a href="#command-parameters">parameters</a></code>;
  attribute string <code><a href="#sessionid">sessionId</a></code>;
};
</pre>

    <p>A command represents a call to a remote end to the <a href="#sessions">session</a> identified by the <code><a href="#sessionid">sessionId</a></code> attribute. By default, the <code><a href="#sessionid">sessionId</a></code> is null. The name of the command to execute is held in the <dfn id="command-name" title="command-name">name</dfn>, and this MUST be handled case-sensitively. It defaults to the null value. The <dfn id="command-parameters" title="command-name">parameters</dfn> attribute is a map of named parameters to objects representing the value of the parameter. The default value is an empty array and this field MUST NOT be null.</p>

  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Response</h3>
    <p>A response represents the value returned from the remote end of the WebDriver API.</p>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface Response">
      <dt>readonly attribute string sessionId</dt>
      <dd>A reference to the session to which this command is associated. The default value is the null value.</dd>
      <dt>readonly attribute integer status</dt>
      <dd>The status code representing the success or failure of the method. Anything other than 0 indicates a failure
      of some kind. The default value is 0.</dd>
      <dt>readonly attribute object value</dt>
      <dd>The return value of the method call. It's type is determined by the <code>Command</code> that has been executed. In the specification, each command definition will make clear what the expected return type is. The default value is the null value.</dd>
    </dl>

	<p>There is no requirement that implementations of Command and Response exhibit any behaviour: they MAY be simple data structures. Reading of values MUST be idempotent, and writing any particular value MUST NOT cause any other values on the Command or Response to change.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Processing Additional Fields on Commands and Responses</h3>
    
    <p>Any Command or Response MAY contain additional fields than those listed
    above. The content of fields MUST be maintained, unaltered by any
    intermediate processing nodes. There is no requirement to maintain the
    ordering of fields.</p>
    
    <div class="note">
      <p>This requirement exists to allow for extension of the protocol, and to allow implementors to decorate Commands and Responses with additional information, perhaps giving context to a series of messages or providing security information.</p>
    </div>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Error Codes</h3>
    <p>The WebDriver API indicates the success or failure of a command invocation via a status code on the 
    <a>Response</a> object. The following values are used and have the following meanings.</p>
    <!-- TODO: These values are derived from existing common usage. Do they need to be reconsidered? -->

    <section>
    <h2>Handling of Error Codes at the Local End</h2>
    
    <p>Error codes are returned from the remote end to the local end. The local end SHOULD convert these into a form appropriate for the implementation language. For example, in C the error codes might be returned "as is", whereas in Java various exceptions could be thrown.</p>
    
    <p>Local implementations written in languages that support exceptions SHOULD make use of an exception hierarchy rooted on a <code>WebDriverException</code> (or similarly named base exception class). Where references to <code>WebDriverException</code> are made in this specification, we are referring to this local end conversion of error codes to local end exceptions.</p>
    
    <p class="note">The reason for this is to allow users of the local end to easily handle the all expected failure modes of a local WebDriver implementation by catching the <code>WebDriverException</code>.</p>
      
     <p class="note">It is strongly recommended that the <code>WebDriverException</code> contain as much diagnostic information as possible, including version numbers and details about the remote end. This is because experience suggests that when reporting errors from tests using WebDriver, users will simply cut-and-paste a stack trace of an exception. Adding this information to the exception makes the task of debugging problems considerably easier.</p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Browser Capabilities</h2>
  <p>Different browsers support different levels of various specifications. For example, some support SVG or the CSS
  Selector API, but only browsers that implement HTML5 will support LocalStorage. The WebDriver API provides
  a mechanism to query the supported capabilities of a browser. Each broad area of functionality
  within the WebDriver API has an associated capability string. Whether a particular capability MUST or MAY
  be supported &mdash; as well as fallback mechanisms for handling those cases
  where a capability is not supported &mdash; is
  discussed where the capability string is defined.</p>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Capabilities</h3>
  <dl class="idl" title="interface Capabilities">
    <dt>readonly attribute dictionary capabilities</dt>
    <dd>The underlying collection of capabilities, represented as a dictionary mapping strings to values which may be
    of type <code>boolean</code>, <code>numerical</code> or <code>string</code>. The default value is an empty dictionary.</dd>
    <dt>boolean has(string capabilityName)</dt>
    <dd>Queries the underlying <code>capabilities</code> to see whether the
    value is set. This MUST return true if the capabilities contain a key with
    the given <code>capabilityName</code> and the value of that key is defined.
    If the value is a boolean, this function MUST return that boolean value. If
    the value is <code>null</code>, an empty string or a 0 then this method MUST return
    false.</dd>
    <dt>(string or boolean or number)? get(string capabilityName)</dt>
    <dd>Get the value of the key matching capabilityName in the underlying <code>capabilities</code> or <code>null</code>if no value is defined.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>A <code>Capabilities</code> instance MUST be immutable. If a mutable <code>Capabilities</code> instance is required, then the <code>MutableCapabilities</code> MUST be used instead.</p>

  <p class="note">The "has" method is designed to provide a quick boolean check on whether or not a particular capability is set and can be used in an "if" statement in many languages. The "get" method returns the exact value. In the case of boolean values, this will be the same result as if "truthy" values are used (that is: <code>get('falseValue')</code> and <code>get('unsetValue')</code> are both false).</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>MutableCapabilities</h3>
  <dl class="idl" title="interface MutableCapabilities : Capabilities">
    <dt>void set(string capabilityName, (string or boolean or number)? value)</dt>
    <dd>Set the value of the given <code>capabilityName</code>to the given <code>value</code>. If the value is not a boolean, numerical type, a string or the null value a <code>WebDriverException</code> SHOULD be thrown.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>In the case where the local and remote end are in the same process, it SHOULD be acceptable to use other types with the <code>set</code> method. If this is allowed, the value MUST be serialized to one of the acceptable types (boolean, numerical type, a string or the null value) before being sent out of process (such as transmitting from the local to the remote end). If this serialization is not possible, a <code>WebDriverException</code> MUST be thrown.</p>

  <div class="note">
	<p>As an example, perhaps the browser being automated supports user profiles. This may be modelled in code as a "Profile" object, leading to code such as:</p>
	<pre class="code">
		profile = Profile("some/user/directory")
		capabilities = MutableCapabilities()
		capabilities.set('profile', profile)
		driver = RemoteDriver(capabilities)
    </pre>

    <p>In this example, the profile represents a directory on the local disk. One way to serialize this would be to zip the contents of this profile and then encode it using base64 to allow it to be passed as a string.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- TODO: can we use a language's natural hash or dictionary type as a capabilities object? -->

</section>
<section>
  <h2>Sessions</h2>
  <p>Non-normative summary: A session is equivalent to a single instantiation of a particular browser, including all
  child windows. The WebDriver API gives each session an opaque string that can be used to differentiate one
  session from another, allowing multiple browsers to be controlled on the same machine if needed, and allowing
  sessions to be routed via a multiplexer. This ID is sent with every <a>Command</a> and returned with every 
  <a>Response</a> and is stored on the <dfn id="sessionid" title="sessionid">sessionId</dfn> field.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Creating a Session</h3>
    <p>The process for successfully creating a session MUST be.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The local end creates a new Capabilities or MutableCapabilities instance describing the desired capabilities
      for the session. The Capabilities object MUST be defined but MAY be empty.</li>
      <li>The local end MUST create a new Command with the "name" being "newSession" and the "parameters" containing an
      entry named "desiredCapabilities" with the value set to the Capabilities instance from the previous step. An optional
      "requiredCapabilities" entry MAY also be created and populated with a Capabilities instance. The "sessionId" fields
      SHOULD be left empty.</li>
      <li>The Command is transmitted to the remote end.</li>
      <li>The remote end MUST examine the "requiredCapabilities" parameter if specified, SHOULD examine the "desiredCapabilities" parameter, and MUST create a new session matching as many of the Capabilities as
      possible.
      How the new session is created depends on the implementation of this specification. 
        <ul>
          <li>If any of the "requiredCapabilities" cannot be fulfilled by the new session, the remote end MUST quit the session and return the
            <code>SessionNotCreated</code> error code. The sessionId of the Response object MUST be left as the default value unless the Command had the sessionId set, in which case that value MUST be used. The error message SHOULD list all unmet required capabilities though only the 
            first unmet required capability MUST be given.</li>
          <li>If a capability is listed in both the requiredCapabilities and desiredCapabilities, the value in the requiredCapabilities MUST be used.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The session MUST be assigned a sessionId which MUST be unique for each session (a UUID is recommended). Generating the sessionId
      MAY occur before the session is created. If the Command object had the "sessionId" field set, this MAY be
      discarded in favour of the freshly generated sessionId. Because of this, it is
      recommended that sessionId generation be done on the remote end. If the sessionId has already been used, a Response MUST be sent with the status 
      code set to <code>SessionNotCreated</code> and the value being an explanation that the sessionId has previously been used.</li>
      <li>The remote end MUST create a new Response object, with the following fields MUST be set to: 
      <ul>
        <li>"sessionId": the <code>sessionId</code> associated with this session.</li>
        <li><a name="create-session-value"></a>"value": a Capabilities instance. The keys of this Capabilities instance MUST be the strings given in each of the supported capabilities as defined in the relevant sections of this specification. Supported functionality MUST be included in this Capabilities instance, while unsupported functionality MAY be omitted.</li>
        <li>"status": the <code>SUCCESS</code> error code.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>The Response is returned to the local end.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There is no requirement for the local end to validate that some or all of the fields sent on the Capabilities
    associated with the Command match those returned in the Response.</p>

    <p>As stated, when returning the <a href="#create-session-value">value of the <code>Response</code></a>, the remote end MUST include the capability names and values of all supported capabilities from this specification. They MAY also include any additional capability names and values of supported capabilities implemented independently of this specification. Local ends MAY choose to ignore this additional information. Nodes intermediate between the local and remote ends MAY interpret the capabilities being returned.</p>

    <p>If the <code>browserName</code> is given as a desired capability and omitted from the required capabilities, and the returned <code>browserName</code> value does not match the requested one, local ends SHOULD issue a warning to the user. How this warning is issued is undefined, but one implementation could be a log message. In this particular case, local ends MAY chose to change the <code>Response</code>'s status code to <code>SessionNotCreated</code>, and modify the value to explain the cause, including the value originally returned as the <code>browserName</code> capability.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Capability Names</h3>
      <p>The following keys SHOULD be used in the Capabilities instances.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><a name="capability-browserName"></a><span class="capability-browserName">browserName</span></dt>

        <h3>Platform Names</h3>
        <p>The following platform names are defined and MUST be used, case sensitively, for the "platformName" unless the actual platform being used is not given in this list:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ANDROID</li>
          <li>IOS</li>
          <li>LINUX</li>
          <li>MAC</li>
          <li>UNIX</li>
          <li>WINDOWS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition "ANY" may be used to indicate the underlying OS is either unknown or does not matter.</p>

        <p>Implementors MAY add additional platform names. Until these are standardized, these MUST follow the conventions outlined in <a href="#extending-the-protocol">extending the protocol</a> section with the exception that the vendor prefix MAY omit the leading "-" character.<p>

        <p class="note">For example, Mozilla's Firefox OS could be described as either "-moz-firefoxos" or "moz-firefoxos". The latter makes it easier for local ends to specify an enum of supported platforms and is therefore recommended in this case.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Success</dt>
        <dd>The session was successfully created. The "value" field of the Response MUST contain a Capabilities object

        <dt>Timeout</dt>
        <dd>The new session could not be created within the time allowed for command execution on the remote end. This
        time MAY be infinite (in which case this status won't be seen). The "value" field of the Response SHOULD contain a string explaining that a timeout has
        occurred, but it MAY be left as the null value or filled with the empty string.</dd>
        <dt>UnknownError</dt>
        <dd>An unhandled error of some sort has occurred. The "value" field of the Response SHOULD contain a more detailed

<h2>Navigation</h2>
  
<p>Almost all usages of the WebDriver API begin by navigating to a particular URL. This section not only describes the commands used for navigation, but also describes when commands must be processed.</p>

<p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support navigating between different HTTP domains and between HTTPS and HTTP domains if the underlying browser supports this.</p>

  there are no outstanding HTTP requests, other than those caused by
  XMLHttpRequests. If a frame or iframe does not contain an HTML document, the remote
  end SHOULD wait until all HTTP traffic to that frame is complete.</dd>

  <dt>normal</dt>
  <dd>The remote end MUST wait until the "<code>document.readyState</code>" of the frame currently handling commands equals "<code>complete</code>", or there are no more outstanding
  network requests other than XMLHttpRequests.</dd>

<p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support the <code>normal</code> and <code>eager</code> modes and SHOULD support the <code>conservative</code> and <code>none</code> modes. If no page loading strategy is chosen, then <code>normal</code> MUST be the default.
In addition, implementors MAY add additional page loading strategies.</p>

<h2>Navigation Commands</h2>

<p class="note">Conformance tests for this section can be found in the <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver-test">webdriver-test module</a> under the "navigation" folder.</p>

<table class="simple">

	</tr>
</table>

<p>The "get" command is used to cause the browser to navigate to a new location, and is named after the HTTP verb. From a user's point of view, this is as if they have entered the "url" into the URL bar. When the command returns is based on the <a href="#page-load-strategies">page load strategy</a> that the user has selected with the following exceptions when the strategy is not "none":

<ul>
    <li>HTTP redirects MUST be automatically followed without responding to the command.</li>
    <li>When a page contains a META tag with the "http-equiv" attribute set to "refresh", a response MUST be returned if the timeout is greater than 1 second and the other criteria for determining whether a page is loaded are met. When the refresh period is 1 second or less and the page loading strategy is "normal" or "conservative" implementations MUST wait for the refresh to complete before responding.</li>
    <li>If any modal dialog box, such as those opened by on <code>window.onbeforeunload</code> or <code>window.alert</code>, is opened at any point in the page load, a response MUST be sent.</li>
    <li>If a 401 response is seen by the browser, a response MUST be sent. That is, if BASIC, DIGEST, NTLM or similar authentication is required, the page load is assumed to be complete. This does not include FORM-based authentication.</li>

  <tr><td><a name="capability-secureSsl"></a><span class="capability-secureSsl">secureSsl</span></td><td>boolean</td></tr>
</table>


<p>WebDriver implementations MUST support users accessing sites served via HTTPS. Access to those sites using self-signed or invalid certificates, and where the certificate does not match the serving domain MUST be the same as if the HTTPS was configured properly.</p>

<p class="note">The reason for this is that implementations of this spec are often used for testing. It's a sorry fact that many QA engineers and testers are asked to verify that apps work on sites that have insecure HTTPS configurations</p>
</section>

<p>The exception to requirement is if the <code>Capabilities</code> used to initialize has the WebDriver session had the capability <code>secureSsl</code> set to true. In this case, implementations MAY choose to make accessing a site with bad HTTPS configurations cause a <code>WebDriverException</code> to be thrown. Remote end implementations MUST return a <code>UnkownError</code> status in this case. <strong>TODO: specify a proper error code for this?</strong> If this is the case, the <code>Capabilities</code> describing the session MUST also set the <code>secureSsl</code> capability to "true".

</section>

<section>
<h3>Detecting When to Handle Commands</h3>

<p>Commands MUST only be processed when the <span id="page-loading-strategies">page loading strategy</span> being used indicates that page loading is complete.</p>

<p>If a remote end receives a new <code>Command</code> for a session while still waiting to finish an existing <code>Command</code> for that session it MAY choose to queue the command for execution as soon as possible, it MAY throw a <code>WebDriverException</code> or it may leave the remote end in an inconsistent state. Because of this, local ends SHOULD NOT attempt to send a new <code>Command</code> to a session until the previous <code>Command</code> has returned.</p>

  <h2>Controlling Windows</h2>

  <section>
    <h2>Defining "window" and "frame"</h2>

    <p>Within this specification, a window equates to anything that would be referred to as "window.top" in javascript. Put another way, within this spec browser tabs are counted as separate windows.</p>

    <p><strong>TODO: define "frame"</strong></p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Window Handles</h2>

    <p>Each window has a "window handle" associated with it. This is an opaque string which MUST uniquely identify the window within the session and MUST NOT be "current". This MAY be a UUID. The "getWindowHandle" command can be used to obtain the window handle for the window that commands are currently acting upon:</p>

    <table class="simple">
      <tr>
        <td>Command Name</td>
        <td>getWindowHandle</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Parameters</td>
        <td>"sessionId" {string} The key that identifies which session this request is for.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Return Value</td>
        <td>{string} The opaque string which uniquely identifies this window within the session.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Iterating Over Windows</h2>

    <table class="simple">
      <tr>
        <td>Command Name</td>
        <td>getWindowHandles</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Parameters</td>
        <td>"sessionId" {string} The key that identifies which session this request is for.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Return Value</td>
        <td>{Array.&lt;string&gt;} An array containing a window handle for every open window in this session.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>This array of returned strings MUST contain a handle for every window associated with the browser session and no others. For each returned window handle the javascript expression "window.top.closed" MUST evaluate to false at the time the command is being executed.</p>

    <p>The ordering of the array elements is not defined, but MAY be determined by iterating over each top level browser window and returning the tabs within that window before iterating over the tabs of the next top level browser window. For example, in the diagram below, the window handles should be returned as the handles for: win1tab1, win1tab2, win2.</p>

    <img src="example-windows.png" alt="Two top level windows. The first window has two tabs, lablled win1tab1 and win1tab2. The second window has only one tab labelled win2"/>

    <p class="note">This implies that the correct way to determine whether or not a particular interaction with the browser opens a new window is done by obtaining the set of window handles before the interaction is performed and comparing with the set after the action is performed.</p>

        <td>Return Value</td>
        <td>None</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The close command closes the window that commands are currently being sent to. If this means that a call to get the list of window handles returns an empty list, then this close command MUST be the equivalent of calling "quit". In all other cases, control MUST be returned to the calling process once the window has been closed or an alert is displayed by the closing window.</p>

    <p>Once the window has closed, future commands MUST return a status code of <code>NoSuchWindow</code> until a new window is selected for receiving commands.</p>

    <p>Each of these commands accept the window handles returned by "<code>getWindowHandles</code>" and "<code>getWindowHandle</code>". In addition, the window handle may be "current", in which case the window that commands are currently being handled by MUST be acted upon.</p>

    <p>The "<code>width</code>" and "<code>height</code>" values refer to the "<code>window.outerheight</code>" and "<code>window.outerwidth</code>" properties. For those browsers that do not support these properties, these represent the height and width of the whole browser window including window chrome and window resizing borders/handles.</p>

    <p>After <code>setWindowSize</code>, the browser window MUST NOT be in the maximised state.</p>

    <p>After  <code>maximizeWindow</code>, the browser window MUST be left as if the maximise button had been pressed; it is not sufficient to leave the window "restored", but with the full screen dimensions.</p>

    <p>After <code>fullscreenWindow</code>, the browser window MUST be in full-screen mode. For those operating systems that support the concept, this MUST be equivalent to if the user requested the window be full screen. If the OS does not support the concept of full-screen, then this command is a synonym for "<code>maximizeWindow</code>".

    <p>If a request is made to resize a window to a size which cannot be performed (e.g. the browser has a minimum, or fixed window size, or the operating system does not support resizing windows at all as is the case in many phone OSs), an UnsupportedOperation status code MUST be returned.</p>

    <h2>Scaling the Content of Windows</h2>

    <p>TODO</p>
  </section>

</section>
<section>
<h2>Where Commands Are Handled</h2>
  
<p>Web applications can be composed of multiple windows and/or frames. For a normal user, the context in which an operation is performed is obvious: it's the window or frame that currently has OS focus and which has just received user input. The WebDriver API does not follow this convention. There is an expectation that many browsers using the WebDriver API may be used at the same time on the same machine. This section describes how WebDriver tracks which window or frame is currently the context in which commands are being executed.</p>
    
<section>
<h2>Default Content</h2>

<p>WebDriver's <dfn>default content</dfn> is the equivalent of <code>window.top</code>.</p>

<p>When a WebDriver instance is started and a single browser window is opened, the default content of that window is automatically selected for receiving further commands. If more than one window is opened when the session starts, then the user MUST first select which window to act upon using the <code>switchToWindow</code> command. Until the user selects a window, all commands must return a status code of <code>NoSuchWindow</code>.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Switching Windows</h2>

<table class="simple">
	<tr>
		<td>Command Name</td>
		<td>switchToWindow</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Parameters</td>
		<td>"sessionId" {string} The key that identifies which session this request is for.<br/>
		    "name" {string} The identifier used for a window.</td>

	    <td>None</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>Errors</td>
	    <td><code>NoSuchWindow</code> if no matching window can be found</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The "switchToWindow" command is used to select which window should currently be accepting commands. In order to determine which window should be used for accepting commands, the "switchToWindow" command MUST iterate over all windows. For each window, the following MUST be compared --- in this order --- with the "name" parameter:
    
    <ol>
        <li>A window handle, obtained from "getWindowHandles" or "getWindowHandle".</li>
        <li>The window name, as defined when the window was opened (the value of "window.name")</li>
        <li>The "id" attribute of the window.</li>
    </ol>

<p>If no windows match, then a "<code>NoSuchWindow</code>" status code MUST be returned, otherwise the "<a href="#default-content">default content</a>" of the first window to match will be selected for accepting commands.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Switching Frames</h2>

<table class="simple">
	<tr>
		<td>Command Name</td>
		<td>switchToFrame</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Parameters</td>
		<td>"sessionId" {string} The key that identifies which session this request is for.<br>
		    "id" {?(string|number|!WebElement=)} The identifier used for a window.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>Return Value</td>
	    <td>None</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>Errors</td>
	    <td><code>NoSuchFrame</code> if no matching frame can be found</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The "switchToFrame" command is used to select which frame within a window should be used for handling future commands. All frame switching is taken from the current context from which commands are currently being handled. The "id" parameter can be one of a string, number of an element. WebDriver implementations MUST determine which frame to select using the following algorithm:

<ol>
    <li>If the "id" is a number the current context is set to the equivalent of the JS expression "window.frames[n]" where "n" is the number and "window" is the DOM window represented by the current context.</li>
    <li>If the "id" is null, the current context is set to the default context.</li>
    <li>If the "id" is a string:
        <ol>
            <li>If the JS expression "window.frames[id]" evaluated in the current context returns a window, where "id" is the value of the the "id" parameter, the current context is set to that.</li>
            <li>Otherwise for each value of "window.frames" (referred to as <code>win</code>):
                <ol>
                    <li>If <code>win</code> has a "name" property or attribute equal to the "id" parameter, this becomes the current context.</li>
                    <li>If <code>win</code> has an "id" property or attribute equal to the "id" parameter, this becomes the current context.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>If the "id" represents a <code>WebElement</code>, and the corresponding DOM element represents a FRAME or an IFRAME, and the WebElement is part of the current context, the "window" property of that DOM element becomes the current context.</li>
</ol>

<p>In all cases if no match is made a "<code>NoSuchFrame</code>" status code MUST be returned.</p>

<p>Frame switching MUST succeed even if doing so would cross a security origin, or javascript executing in window.top's context would otherwise not be able to access the frame being switched to.</p>

  <h2>Running Without Window Focus</h2>
  <p>All browsers must comply with the <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#focus">focus</a> section of
  the [[!HTML5]] spec. In particular, the requirement that the element within a top-level browsing
  context be independent of whether or not the top-level browsing context itself
  has system focus MUST be followed.</p>

  <p class="note">This requirement is put in place to allow efficient machine
  utilization when using the WebDriver API to control several browsers
  independently on the same desktop</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Elements</h2>
  <p>One of the key abstractions of the WebDriver API is the 
  <a>WebElement</a> interface. Each instance of this interface represents an 
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-dom-20120105/#interface-element">Element</a> as defined in the
  [[!DOM4]] specification. Because the WebDriver API is designed to allow users to interact with apps as if
  they were actual users, the capabilities offered by the 
  <code>WebElement</code> interface are somewhat different from those offered by the DOM Element interface.</p>

  <p>Each WebElement instance must have an ID, which is distinct from the value
  of the DOM Element's "id" property. The ID for every WebElement representing the same
  underlying DOM Element MUST be the same. The IDs used to refer to different
  underlying DOM Elements MUST be unique within the session over the entire duration of the session.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <p>This requirement around WebElement IDs allows for efficient equality
    checks when the WebDriver API is being used out of process.</p>

      <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/selectors-api/">CSS Selectors API</a> ([[!SELECTORS-API]]) it MUST support locating elements by
      CSS Selector. If the browser does not support the browser CSS Selector spec it MAY choose to implement locating
      by this mechanism. If the browser can support locating elements by CSS Selector, it MUST set the "cssSelector" capability to boolean true when responding to the <a href="#creating-a-session">"newSession" command</a>. Elements MUST be returned in the same order as if "<code>querySelectorAll</code>" had been called with the <code>Locator</code>s <code>value</code>. Compound selectors are allowed.</p>

      <h2>Element ID</h2>
      <p>Strategy name: id</p>
      <p>This strategy MUST be supported by all WebDriver implementations.</p>
      <p>The HTML5 specification ([[!HTML5]]) states that <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#the-id-attribute">element
        IDs must be unique within their home subtree</a>. Sadly, this uniqueness
      requirement is not always met. Consequently, this strategy is equally
      valid for finding a single element or groups of elements. In the case of
      finding a single WebElement, this MUST be functionally identical to a call
      to "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-dom-20120105/#dom-document-getelementbyid">document.getElementById()</a>"
      from the Web DOM Core specification ([[!DOM4]]). When finding multiple
      elements, this is equivalent to an CSS query of "<code>#value</code>" where "value" is the ID being searched for with all "'" characters being properly escaped..</p>

        <li>The element MUST NOT be visible if that element, or any of its ancestors,
        is hidden or has a CSS display property that is none.</li>
        <li>The element MUST NOT be visible if there is a <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transforms/'>CSS3 Transform</a>
        property that moves the element out of the viewport and can not be scrolled to.</li>
        <li>OPTIONs and OPTGROUP elements are treated as special cases, they are considered shown if and only if the enclosing select element is visible.</li>
        <li>MAP elements are shown if and only if the image it uses is visible. Areas within
        a map are shown if the enclosing MAP is visible.</li>
        <li>Any INPUT elements of "type=hidden" are not visible</li>
        <li>Any NOSCRIPT elements MUST NOT be visible if Javascript is enabled.</li>

    <h2><a name="attributes-and-properties"></a>Reading Attributes and Properties</h2>
    <p>Although the [[!HTML5]] spec is very clear about the difference between the properties and attributes of a DOM element, users are frequently confused between the two. Because of this, the WebDriver API offers a single command ("getElementAttribute") which covers the case of returning either of the value of a DOM element's property or attribute. If a user wishes to refer specifically to an attribute or a property, they should evaluate Javascript in order to be unambiguous. In this section, the "attribute" with name <code>name</code> shall refer to the result of calling the Javascript "getAttribute" function on the element, with the following exceptions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If, in the current rendering mode, the content attribute <code>name</code> reflects a boolean IDL attribute, as per <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/">the HTML specification</a>, the value MUST be the string 'true' if that IDL attribute's value is true or the null value if the IDL attribute's value is false.</li>
      <li>If the element is an OPTION element and <code>name</code> is "value" and there is no "value" attribute, then the text content of the OPTION element MUST be returned, in accordance with [[!HTML401]] spec, specifically the section on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/interact/forms.html#adef-value-OPTION">pre-selected options</a>. The text content MUST be the result of calling the "getElementText" command on the OPTION element.</li>
      <li>If the element is selectable, and <code>name</code> is "selected", or the element is an INPUT element of type "checkbox" or "radio" and <code>name</code> is "checked", return the string 'true' if the element is selected, and the null value otherwise.</li>
      <li>If <code>name</code> is "style", the value returned MUST be <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#serialize-a-css-rule">serialized as defined</a> in the [[!CSSOM-VIEW]] spec. Notably, css property names MUST be cased the same as specified in in section 6.5.1 of the [[!CSSOM-VIEW]] spec.
        <ul>
          <li>Consequently, it SHOULD be equivalent to obtaining the "cssText" property, with the additional constraint that the same value MUST be returned after a round trip through "executeScript". That is, the following pseudo-code MUST be true (where "driver" is a WebDriver instance, and "element" is a WebElement):
<pre class="code">
var style = element.getAttribute('style');
driver.executeScript('arguments[0].style = arguments[1]', element, style);
var recovered = element.getAttribute('style');
assertEquals(style, recovered);
</pre>
          </li>
          <li>Color property values MUST be standardized to rgba format, matching the regular expression: <code>rgba\(\d+,\s*\d+,\s*\d+\s*(,\s*(1|0(\.\d+)?)))</code>.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li>If the value is expected to be a URL (see the below table), return the property named <code>name</code>, i.e. a fully resolved URL:
        <strong>TODO: This doesn't feel like an exhaustive list</strong>
        <table class="simple">
            <tr>
                <th>Tag name</th>

                <td>src</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
      </li>
      <li>If <code>name</code> is in the below table, and the above stages have not yielded a defined, non-null value, the value of the aliased attribute in the table below should be returned:
      <table class="simple">

   <h2>Rendering Text</h2>
   <p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support getting the <a
     href="#determining-visibility">visible</a> text of a <code>WebElement</code>, with excess whitespace compressed.</p>
   
<p>The following definitions are used in this section:
    <dl>
        <dt id="text.whitespace">Whitespace</dt>
        <dd>Any text that matches the ECMAScript regular expression class <code>\s</code>.
        
        <dt id="text.whitespace-nbsp">Whitespace excluding non-breaking spaces</dt>
        <dd>Any text that matches the ECMAScript regular expression <code>[^\S\xa0]</code>
            
        <dt id="text.blocklevel">Block level element</dt>
        <dd>A block-level element is one which is not a table cell, and whose effective CSS display style is not in the set ['inline', 'inline-block', 'inline-table', 'none', 'table-cell', 'table-column', 'table-column-group']</dd>
        
        <dt id="text.horizontal">Horizontal whitespace characters</dt>
        <dd>Horizontal whitespace characters are defined by the ECMAScript regular expression <code>[\x20\t\u2028\u2029]</code>.</dd>
    </dl>

<p>The expected return value is roughly what a text-only browser would display. The algorithm for determining this text is as follows:</p>

<p>Let <code>lines</code> equal an empty array. Then:
<ol>  
    <li><span id="text.1">For</span> each <code>child</code> of node, at time of execution, in order:
        <ol>
            <li>Get whitespace, text-transform, and then, if <code>child</code> is:
                <ul>
                    <li>a node which is not <a href="#determining-visibility">visible</a>, do nothing</li>
                    <li>a [[!DOM4]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-dom-20120105/#interface-text">text node</a> let <code>text</code> equal the <code>nodeValue</code> property of <code>child</code>. Then:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Remove any zero-width spaces (\u200b), form feeds (\f) or vertical tab feeds (\v) from <code>text</code>.</li>
                            <li>Canonicalize any recognized single newline sequence in <code>text</code> to a single newline (greedily matching <code>(\r\n|\r|\n)</code> to a single \n)</li>
                            <li>If the parent's effective CSS whitespace style is 'normal' or 'nowrap' replace each newline (\n) in <code>text</code> with a single space character (\x20). If the parent's effective CSS whitespace style is 'pre' or 'pre-wrap' replace each <a href="#text.horizontal">horizontal whitespace character</a> with a non-breaking space character (\xa0). Otherwise replace each sequence of <a href="#text.horizontal">horizontal whitespace characters</a> except non-breaking spaces (\xa0) with a single space character</li>
                            <li>Apply the parent's effective CSS text-transform style as per the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/text.html#propdef-text-transform">CSS 2.1 specification</a> ([[!CSS21]])</li>
                            <li>If <code>last(lines)</code> ends with a space character and <code>text</code> starts with a space character, trim the first character of <code>text</code>.</li>
                            <li>Append <code>text</code> to <code>last(lines)</code> in-place</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>an element which is <a href="#determining-visibility">visible</a>. If the element is a:
                        <ul>
                            <li>BR element: Push '' to <code>lines</code> and continue</li>
                            <li><a href="#text.blocklevel">Block-level</a> element and if <code>last(lines)</code> is not '', push '' to <code>lines</code>.</li>
                        </ul>
                    And then recurse depth-first to <a href="#text.1">step 1</a> at the beginning of the algorithm with <code>child</code> set to the current element</li>
                    <li>If element is a TD element, or the effective CSS display style is 'table-cell', and last(lines) is not '', and <code>last(lines)</code> does not end with whitespace append a single space character to <code>last(lines)</code> [Note: Most innerText implementations append a \t here]</li>
                    <li>If element is a block-level element: push '' to <code>lines</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The string MUST then have the white space normalised as defined in the [[!XPATH]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/#function-normalize-space">normalize-space function</a> which is then returned.</li>

  <h2>User Input</h2>
  <p>The WebDriver API offers two ways of interacting with elements,
  either with a set of low-level "do as I say" commands, or a
  high-level "do as I mean" set of commands. The former are offered to
  allow precise emulation of user input. The latter are offered as a
  convenience to cover the common case, and can conceivably be
  implemented on top of the lower level primitive operations.</p>

  <section>
    <h2 id="interactable">Interactable elements</h2>
    <p>Some input actions require the element to be interactable. The following conditions must be met for the element to be considered interactable:
    <ul>
      <li>The element MUST be visible, as defined in <a href="#determining-visibility">section 10.1</a>.</li>
      <li>The element MUST NOT be disabled. "Disabled" is defined as:
      <ul>
        <li>If the current document is being processed as an HTML 4 document, the element MUST be considered disabled if it does not support
        the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#adef-disabled">disabled</a>
        attribute (according to the [[!HTML401]] spec), or if the
        disabled attribute is set in the case where that attribute is present.</li>
        <li>If the currently loaded document is an HTML 5 document,
          the element is
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#adef-disabled">disabled</a>
          as defined in the [[!HTML5]] spec.</li>

    <section>
      <h2>Low Level Commands</h2>
      <p>The low level commands provide a mechanism for precisely stating how a user can interact with the browser. 

    <p>User input SHOULD be emulated natively, with the input events
    being indistinguishable from those generated by a real user
    interacting with the browser. It is therefore recommended that
    input events SHOULD NOT be generated at the DOM level using the
    "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#dom-document-createevent">createEvent</a>"
    API from [[!DOM4]] or similar. Instead, emulated input events
    SHOULD originate from the browser's own event queue. This is the
    order of preference for methods to emulate user input:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Injection into the browser's event queue.</li>
      <li>Sending OS-specific input messages to the browser's window. This has the disadvantage that the browser being automated may not be properly isolated from a user accidentally modifying input device state.</li>
      <li>Use of Javascript to inject events at the DOM level.</li>
      <li>Use of the accessibility API. The disadvantage of this method is that the browser's window must be focused. As a result, multiple tests cannot run in parallel.</li>
    </ul>

      <p>TODO: Describe the commands for basic control of keyboard and mouse.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Mouse</h2>
        <p>TODO: Ensure that this section mentions that mouse state MUST be maintained if the page is not related and MAY be maintained if the browser navigates to a new page.</p>

    <section>
    <h2>High Level Commands</h2>
    <p>These higher level commands SHOULD be built on top of the low level commands, and implement a user friendly way of interacting with a page in a way that models common user expectations.

    <section>
    <h2>Clicking</h2>
    <dl class="idl" title="partial interface WebElement">
      <dt>void click()</dt>
      <dd>Click in the middle of the <code>WebElement</code> instance. The middle of the element is defined as the middle of the box returned by
      calling <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view/#the-getclientrects-and-getboundingclientrect-methods">getBoundingClientRect</a>
      on the underlying DOM Element, according to the [[!CSSOM-VIEW]] spec. If
      the element is outside the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#viewport">viewport</a>
      (according to the [[!CSS21]] spec), the implementation SHOULD bring the
      element into view first. The implementation MAY invoke scrollIntoView on
      the underlying DOM Element. The element MUST be visible, as defined in <a
        href="#determining-visibility">section 10.1</a>. See the note below for when the element is obscured by another element.
      Exceptions:
      <ul>
        <li>Links (A elements): Clicking happens in the middle of the first
        <a href="#determining-visibility">visible</a> bounding client rectangle. This is to overcome overflowing links where the middle of the bounding client rectangle does not actually fall on a clickable part of the link.</li>
        <li>SELECT elements without the &quot;multiple&quot; attribute set.
        Clicking on the select element SHOULD open the drop down menu. The next
        click, on any element, MUST close this menu.</li>
        <li>Clicking directly on an OPTION element (without clicking on the
        parent SELECT element previously) MUST open a selection menu, as if the
        SELECT option was clicked first, then click on the OPTION before finally
        closing the SELECT element's menu. The the SELECT menu MUST be closed
        once the action is complete.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The possible errors for this command:
      <ul>
        <li>StaleElementReference if the given element is no longer attached to the DOM.</li>
        <li>ElementNotVisible if the element is hidden and thus cannot be interacted with.</li>
        <li>MoveTargetOutOfBounds if the element cannot be scrolled into view.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This command MUST use either the mouse or touch mechanisms for
      emulating the user input. In the case where the browser being automated
      supports only mouse input or both mouse and touch input, the low-level
      mouse mechanisms MUST be used. If the browser only supports touch input,
      the low level touch inputs MUST be used.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p class="note">As the goal is to emulate users as closely as possible, the
    implementation SHOULD NOT allow clicking on elements that are obscured by
    other elements. If the implementation forbids clicking on obscured elements,
    an <code>ElementNotVisible</code> exception MUST be thrown and this SHOULD have an
    explantory message explaining the reason. The implementation SHOULD try to
    scroll the element into view, but in case it is fully obscured, it SHOULD
    NOT be clickable.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Typing keys</h2>
    <p>A requirement for key-based interaction with an element is that it is
    <a href="#interactable">interactable</a>. Typing into an element is permitted if one of the following conditions is met:
    <ul>
      <li>The element is <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#focus">focusable</a> as defined in the editing section of the [[!HTML5]] spec.</li>
      <li>The element is allowed to be the <code>activeElement</code>. In
      addition to focusable elements, this allows typing to the <code>BODY</code> element.</li>
      <li>In an HTML5 document, the element is <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#attr-contenteditable">editable</a> as a result of having its <code>contentEditable</code> attribute set or the containing document is in <code>designMode</code>.</li>
      <li>The underlying browser implementation would allow keyboard input to
      directed to the element (eg. an HTML 4 document with a DIV marked as being
      contentEditable)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Prior to any keyboard interaction, an attempt to shift focus to the
    element MUST be attempted if the element does not currently have the focus. This is the case if one of the following
    holds:
    <ul>
      <li>The element is not <code>document.activeElement</code></li>
      <li>The owner document of the element to be interacted with is not the
      focused document.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In case focusing is needed, the implementation MUST follow the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/editing.html#focus-management"><b>focusing steps</b></a> as described in the focus management section of the [[!HTML5]] spec. The focus MUST NOT leave the element at the end of the interaction, other than as a result of the interaction itself (i.e. when the tab key is sent).
    </p>
    <dl class="idl" title="partial interface WebElement">
      <dt>void clear()</dt>
      <dd>Clears the value of the element.</dd>
      <dt>void sendKeys(string[] keysToSend)</dt>
      <dd>Sends a sequence of keyboard events representing the keys in the keysToSend parameter.
      <p>Caret positioning: If focusing was needed, after following the focusing steps, the caret MUST be positioned at the end of the text currently in the element. At the end of the interaction, the caret MUST be positioned at the end of the typed text sequence, unless the keys sent position it otherwise (e.g. using the LEFT key).</p>
      <p>There are four different types of keys that are emulated:
      <ul>
        <li>Character literals - lower-case symbols.</li>
        <li>Uppercase letters and symbols requiring the SHIFT key for typing.</li>
        <li>Modifier keys</li>
        <li>Special keys</li>
      </ul>The rest of this section details the values used to represent the different keys, as well as the expected behaviour for each key type.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>When emulating user input, the implementation MUST generate
    the same sequence of events that would have been produced if a real user was
    sitting in front of the keyboard and typing the sequence of characters. In
    cases where there is more than one way to type this sequence, the
    implementation MUST choose one of the valid ways. For example, typing <code>AB</code> may be achieved by:
    <ul>
      <li>Holding down the Shift key</li>

      <li>Pressing the letter 'a'</li>
      <li>Releasing the Shift key</li>
      <li>Holding down the Shift key</li>
      <li>Pressing the letter 'b'</li>
      <li>Releasing the Shift key</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Or by simply turning on the CAPS LOCK first.</p>
    <p>
    The implementation MAY use the following algorithm to generate the events.
    If the implementation is using a different algorithm, it MUST adhere to the
    requirements listed below.
    <p>For each key, <var>key</var> in <var>keysToSend</var>, do

      <ol>
        <li>If the Shift key is not pressed:
        <ol>
          <li>Generate a key-down event of the Shift key.

    <p> <!-- Pseudo-code --></p>
    <p>Any implementation MUST comply with these requirements:
    <ul>
      <li>For uppercase letters and symbols that require the Shift key to be
      pressed, there are two options:
      <ul>
        <li>A single Shift key-down event is generated before the entire
        sequence of uppercase letters.</li>
        <li>Before each such letter or symbol, a Shift key-down event is
        generated. After each letter or symbol, a Shift key-up event is
        generated.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>A user-specified Shift press implies capitalization of all following
      characters.</li>
      <li>If a user-specified Shift press precedes uppercase letters and
      symbols, a second Shift key-down event MUST NOT be generated. In that
      case, a Shift key-up event MUST NOT be generated implicitly by the
      implementation.</li>
      <li>The <var>NULL</var> key releases all currently held down modifier keys.</li>
      <li>The state of all modifier keys must be reset at the end of each
      <code>sendKeys</code> call and the appropriate key-up events
      generated</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <!-- Algorithm paragraph --></p>
    <h3>Character types</h3>
    <p>The <var>keysToSend</var> parameter contains a mix of printable

    <p>The keys considered upper-case symbols are either defined by the current keyboard locale or are derived from the US 104 keys Windows keyboard layout, which are:

      <li>!$^*()+{}:?|~@#%_\" &amp; &lt; &gt;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When the user input is emulated natively (see note below), the implementation SHOULD use the current keyboard locale to determine which symbols are upper case. In all other cases, the implementation MUST use the US 104 key Windows keyboard layout to determine those symbols.</p>

  <h2>Screenshots</h2>
  <p>Screenshots are a powerful mechanism for providing information to users of WebDriver, particularly once a particular WebDriver instance has been disposed of. In different circumstances, users want different types of screenshot. Note that the WebDriver spec does not provide a mechanism for taking a screenshot of the entire screen.</p>

  <p>In all cases, screenshots MUST be returned as lossless PNG images encoded using Base64. Local ends MUST provide the user with access to the PNG images without requiring the user to decode the Base64. This access MUST be via at least one of a binary blob or a file.</p>

  <p>All commands within this section are implemented using the "TakesScreenshot" interface:</p>
  
  <dl class="idl" title="interface TakesScreenshot">
    <dt>string takeScreenshot()</dt>
    <dd>Take a screenshot as determined by the CommandName and return a lossless PNG encoded using Base64.</dd>  
  </dl>

  <section>
    <h2>Current Window</h2>
    <table class="simple">
      <tr><td>Capability Name</td><td>Type</td></tr>
      <tr><td><a name="capability-takesScreenshot"></a><span class="capability-takesScreenshot">takesScreenshot</span></td><td>boolean</td></tr>
    </table>

	<table class="simple">
      <tr>
	    <td>Command Name</td>
	    <td>takesScreenshot</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Parameters</td>
	    <td>"sessionId" {string} The key that identifies which session this request is for.<br/>
	    </td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Return Value</td>
	    <td>{string} A Base64 encoded, lossless PNG of the current window.</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>Errors</td>
	      <td>
		    WebDriverException if the screenshot cannot be taken.
	      </td>
	    </tr>
	</table>

    <p>If this capability is supported, local end MUST add the <code>TakesScreenshot</code> interface to the <code>WebDriver</code> interface.</p>

    <p>This command will take a screenshot of the current window. Implementations of the remote end SHOULD capture the entire DOM, even if this would require a user to scroll the browser window. That is, the returned PNG SHOULD have the same width and height as returned by a call to <code>getSize</code> of the BODY element and MUST contain all visible content on the page, and this SHOULD be done without resizing the browser window. If the remote end is unable to capture the entire DOM, then the part of the DOM currently displayed in UI of the browser MUST be captured without additional chrome such as scrollbars and browser chrome.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>One way to think of capturing the entire DOM is that the user has an infinitely large monitor and has resized the window to allow all content to be visible. One of those monitors would be very cool.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Nested frames MUST be sized as if the user has resized the window to the dimensions of the PNG being returned. This often means that not all potentially visible content within the nested frames is captured.</p>

    <p>Remote ends MUST NOT attempt to track changes in window size as the screenshot is being taken. In particular this means that in the case of a page that makes use of "infinite scrolling" (where an AJAX call is used to populate additional content as the user scrolls down) or in some other way resizes content as the window size is changed only the content that was originally contained in the DOM when the command is executed will be captured.</p>

  	</table>
  	
  	<p>If this capability is supported, local end MUST add the <code>TakesScreenshot</code> interface to the <code>WebElement</code> interface.</p>
  	
    <p>Remote ends SHOULD take a screenshot of the area bounded by the clientBoundingRect of the DOM element represented by the <code>WebElement</code>, returning it as a Base64 encoded, lossless PNG. Local ends MUST make the PNG available directly to the user as at least one of a binary blob or a file. If the remote end cannot capture the entire clientBoundingRect, they MUST scroll as much of the element into the current browser viewport as possible and capture the maximum visible area without additional browser chrome.</p>
    
    <p>If the <code>WebElement</code> represents a FRAME or IFRAME element, this is equivalent of taking a screenshot of the frame's BODY element.</p>

    <h2>Extending the Protocol</h2>
    <p></p>
    <section>
      <h3>Vendor-specific Extensions</h3>
      <p>The WebDriver protocol is designed to allow extension to meet vendor-specific needs, such as interacting with the chrome of a browser. Vendor-specific extensions are implemented by appending a prefix to the command name. This should be of the form:</p>
      <pre>
        '-' + vendor prefix + '-' + command name
      </pre>
      <p>For example: "<code>-o-open-bookmark</code>" or "<code>-moz-install-extension</code>".</p>
      <p>It is guaranteed that no command name in this or future versions of the WebDriver specification will be prefixed with a leading dash.</p>
      
      <div class="note">
        It is suggested that vendors use the same vendor identifier as in [[!CSS21]] (notably, section <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">4.1.2.2</a>)
      </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Extending the JSON/HTTP Protocol</h3>
      <p>This section is non-normative.</p>
      <p>The wire protocol (see Appendix XXX) makes use of URLs to distinguish command names. When extending the protocol by adding new URLs, vendors should use their vendor prefix without additional characters to prevent any potential clashes with other implementations. This leads to URLs of the form: <code>http://host:port/session/somekey/<b>moz</b>/extension</code>.
