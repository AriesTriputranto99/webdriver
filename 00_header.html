<section id='abstract'>
<p>This specification defines the WebDriver API, a platform-and language-neutral interface that allows programs or scripts to introspect into, and control the behaviour of, a web browser. The WebDriver API is primarily intended to allow developers to write tests that automate a browser from a separate controlling process, but may also be implemented in such a way as to allow in-browser scripts to control a (separate?) browser.</p>

<p>The WebDriver API is defined by a set of interfaces to discover and manipulate DOM elements on a page, and to control the behaviour of the containing browser.</p>

<p>This specification also includes a non-normative reference serialisation (to JSON) of the interface's invocations and responses that may be useful for browser vendors.</p>
