  <h2>Sessions</h2>
  <p>Non-normative summary: A session is equivalent to a single instantiation of a particular browser, including all
  child windows. The WebDriver API gives each session a unique ID stored as an opaque string that can be used to differentiate one
  session from another, allowing multiple browsers to be controlled on the same machine if needed, and allowing
  sessions to be routed via a multiplexer. This ID is sent with every <code><a>Command</a></code> and returned with every
  <code><a>Response</a></code> and is stored on the <dfn id='#sessionId' title="sessionid">sessionId</dfn> field.</p>

    <h3>Creating a Session</h3>
    <p><table class="simple jsoncommand">
      <tr>
        <th>HTTP Method</th>
        <th>Path Template</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>

      <dt>attribute DOMString sessionId </dt>
      <dd>An opaque string that relates to the <a href='#sessionId'>sessionId</a>.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The process for successfully creating a session MUST be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>On the Local End:
        <ol>
          <li>Let caps be a new <a>Capabilities</a> instance.</li>
          <li>let command be a new <a>Command</a> instance with the "parameters" object
           containing a key named "capabilities" with the value set to the <a>Capabilities</a> instance from the previous step. The "sessionId" fields
          SHOULD be left empty.</li>
          <li>The <a>Command</a> is transmitted to the remote end.</li>
        </ol>
      <li>On the Remote End</li>
        <ol>
          <li>TODO: Add way to decode</li>
          <li>Let capabilities be an object that is equal to <a href='#command-parameters'>parameters</a> object on <a>Command</a>.</li>
          <li>Iterate over capabilities and compare it against keys in User Agents <a>Capabilities</a> object. If the values the remote end has does not match what was sent from the local end the remote end MUST quit and return <code><a href="#status-session-not-created">session not created</a></code> error code.
          <div class='note'>
            <p>The suggested order for comparing keys in the <a>Capabilities</a> instance when creating a session is:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>browserName</li>
              <li>browserVersion</li>
              <li>platformName</li>
              <li>platformVersion</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For all comparisons, if the key is missing (as determined by a call to Capability.has() returning "false"), that particular criteria shall not factor into the
            comparison.</p>
          </div>
          <li>The sessionId of the <a>Response</a> object MUST be left as the default value unless the <a>Command</a> had the sessionId set, in which case that value MUST be used. The error message SHOULD list all unmet required capabilities though only a single required capability MUST be given.</li>


          <li>The session MUST be assigned a <code><a href="#sessionid">sessionId</a></code> which MUST be unique for each session (a UUID SHOULD be used). Generating the sessionId
          MAY occur before the session is created. If the <a>Command</a> object had the "sessionId" field set, this MAY be
          discarded in favour of the freshly generated sessionId. Because of this, it is
          recommended that sessionId generation be done on the remote end. If the sessionId has already been used, a <a>Response</a> MUST be sent with the status
          code set to <code><a href="#status-session-not-created">session not created</a></code> and the value being an explanation that the sessionId has previously been used.</li>
          <li>The remote end MUST create a new <code><a>Response</a></code> object, with the following fields MUST be set to:
          <ul>
            <li>"sessionId": the <code>sessionId</code> associated with this session.</li>
            <li name="create-session-value">"value": a <a>Capabilities</a> instance. The keys of this <a>Capabilities</a> instance MUST be the strings given in each of the supported <a>Capabilities</a> as defined in the relevant sections of this specification. Supported functionality MUST be included in this <a>Capabilities</a> instance, while unsupported functionality MAY be omitted. User Agents MAY include any additional capabilities that have been implemented independently of this specification.</li>
            <li>"status": the <code><a href="#status-success">success</a></code> status code.</li>
          </ul></li>
      </li>

      <li>The <a>Response</a> is returned to the local end.</li>
    </ol>
    </ul>

   <section>
      <h3>Capability Names</h3>
      <p>The following keys SHOULD be used in the <a>Capabilities</a> instances. They all default to the null string.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><span id="capability-browserName">browserName</span></dt>
        <dd>The name of the desired browser as a string.</dd>
        <dt><span id="capability-browserVersion">browserVersion</span></dt>
        <dd>The version number of the browser, given as a string.</dd>
        <dt><span id="capability-platformName">platformName</span></dt>
        <dd>The OS that the browser is running on, matching any of the platform names given below.</dd>
        <dt><span id="capability-platformVersion">platformVersion</span></dt>
        <dd>The version of the OS that the browser is running on as a string.</dd>
      </dl>

      <section>
        <h3>Platform Names</h3>
        <p>The following platform names are defined and MUST be used, case sensitively, for the "platformName" unless the actual platform being used is not given in this list:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>android</li>
          <li>ios</li>
          <li>linux</li>
          <li>mac</li>
          <li>unix</li>
          <li>windows</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition "any" MAY be used to indicate the underlying OS is either unknown or does not matter.</p>

        <p>Implementors MAY add additional platform names. Until these are standardized, these MUST follow the conventions outlined in <a href="#extending-the-protocol">extending the protocol</a> section with the exception that the vendor prefix SHOULD omit the leading "-" character.<p>

        <p class="note">For example, Mozilla's Firefox OS could be described as either "-MOZ-FIREFOXOS". The latter makes it easier for local ends to specify an enum of supported platforms and is therefore recommended in this case.</p>

      <h3>Error Handling</h3>
      <p>The following status codes MUST be returned by the "newSession" command:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><code><a href="#status-success">success</a></code></dt>
        <dd>The session was successfully created. The "value" field of the <code><a>Response</a></code> MUST contain a <a>Capabilities</a> object describing the session.</dd>
        <dt><code><a href="#status-timeout">timeout</a></code></dt>
        <dd>The new session could not be created within the time allowed for command execution on the remote end. This
        time MAY be infinite (in which case this status won't be seen). The "value" field of the <a>Response</a> SHOULD contain a string explaining that a timeout has
        occurred, but it MAY be left as the null value or filled with the empty string.</dd>
        <dt><code><a href="#status-unknown-error">unknown error</a></code></dt>
        <dd>An unhandled error of some sort has occurred. The "value" field of the <a>Response</a> SHOULD contain a more detailed
        description of the error as a string.</dd>
      </dl>

    <h3>Removing a Session</h3>

    <p>When removing the session the User Agent MUST do the following
      <ol>
        <li>If the <a href='#sessionid'>sessionId</a> does not exist an <code><a href="#status-unsupported-operation">unsupported operation</a></code> will be returned.</li>
