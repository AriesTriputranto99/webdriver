  <h2>Sessions</h2>
  <p>Non-normative summary: A session is equivalent to a single instantiation of a particular browser, including all
  child windows. The WebDriver API gives each session a UUID stored as a string that can be used to differentiate one
  session from another, allowing multiple browsers to be controlled on the same machine if needed, and allowing
  sessions to be routed via a multiplexer. This ID is sent with every <a>Command</a> and returned with every 
  <a>Response</a> and is stored on the <code>sessionId</code> field.</p>

    <h3>Creating a Session</h3>
    <p>The process for successfully creating a session follows.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The local end creates a new Capabilities or MutableCapabilities instance describing the desired capabilities
      for the session. The Capabilities object MAY be empty, but MUST be defined.</li>
      <li>The local end creates a new Command with the "name" being "newSession" and the "parameters" containing an
      entry named "desiredCapabilities" with the value set to the Capabilities instance from the previous step. An optional
      "requiredCapabilities" entry MAY also be created and populated with a Capabilities instance. The "sessionId" fields
      SHOULD be left empty.</li>
      <li>The Command is serialized and transmitted to the remote end.</li>
      <li>The remote end examines the two Capabilities parameters, and creates a new session matching as many of the Capabilities as
      possible from the "desiredCapabilities" and all of the Capabilities given in the "requiredCapabilities".
      How the new session is created depends on the implementation of this specification. In the case of a
      browser automation framework, it is expected that a new instance of the browser is started if possible.
        <ul>
          <li>If any of the "requiredCapabilities" cannot be fulfilled by the new session, the remote end MUST quit the session and return the
            <code>SessionNotCreatedException</code> error code. The error message SHOULD list all unmet required capabilities though only the 
            first unmet required capability MUST be given.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The session must be assigned a UUID which MUST be unique for each session (by definition). Generating the UUID
      MAY occur before the session is created. If the Command object had the "sessionId" field set, this MAY be
      discarded in favour of the freshly generated UUID. Because of this, it is
      recommended that UUID generation be done on the remote end. If the UUID has already been used, a Response MUST be sent with the status 
      code set to <code>SessionNotCreatedException</code> and the value being an explanation that the UUID has previously been used.</li>
      <li>The remote end create a new Response object. 
      <ul>
        <li>The "sessionId" field is assigned the UUID associated with this session.</li>
        <li>The session is described by filling a Capabilities instance with keys matching the parts of this
        specification that can be fulfilled. This is assigned to the "value" field of the Response. This fields MUST
        be filled</li>
        <li>The "status" field is set to the <code>SUCCESS</code> error code.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>The Response is transmitted or returned back to the local end.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There is no requirement for the local end to validate that some or all of the fields sent on the Capabilities
    associated with the Command match those returned in the Response.</p>

      <h3>Capability Names</h3>
      <p>The following keys are to be used in the Capabilities instances.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>browserName</dt>
        <dd>The name of the desired browser as a string</dd>
        <dt>browserVersion</dt>
        <dd>The version number of the browser, given as a string</dd>
        <dt>platformName</dt>
        <dd>The OS that the browser is running on, matching any of the platform names given below.</dd>
        <dt>platformVersion</dt>
        <dd>The version of the OS that the browser is running on as a string.</dd>
      </dl>

      <section>
        <h3>Platform Names</h3>
        <p>These SHOULD be named in the style of enums in C-like languages.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ANDROID</li>
          <li>IOS</li>
          <li>LINUX</li>
          <li>MAC</li>
          <li>UNIX</li>
          <li>WINDOWS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition "ANY" may be used to indicate the underlying OS is either unknown or does not matter.
        Implementors MAY add additional platform names.</p>

      <h3>Error Handling</h3>
      <p>The following status codes MUST be returned by the "newSession" command. Please consult the table in the
      "commands" section for numerical values:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Success</dt>
        <dd>The session was successfully created. The "value" field of the Response MUST contain a Capabilities object
        describing the session</dd>
        <dt>Timeout</dt>
        <dd>The new session could not be created within the time allowed for command execution on the remote end. This
        time MAY be infinite. The "value" field of the Response SHOULD contain a string explaining that a timeout has
        occurred, but it MAY be left empty or filled with the empty string.</dd>
        <dt>UnknownError</dt>
        <dd>An unhandled error of some sort has occurred. The "value" field of the Response SHOULD contain a more detailed
        description of the error.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>Remote End Matching of Capabilities</h3>
      <p>This section is non-normative.</p>
      <p>The suggested order for comparing keys in the Capabilities instance when creating a session is:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>browserName</li>
        <li>browserVersion</li>
        <li>platform</li>
        <li>platformVersion</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For all comparisons, if the key is missing (as determined by a call to Capability.has()), that particular criteria shall not factor into the
      comparison.</p>
