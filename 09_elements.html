  <h2>Elements</h2>
  <p class="note">Conformance tests for this section can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/webdriver/">webdriver module</a> under the "element_location" folder.</p>
  <p>One of the key abstractions of the WebDriver API is the
  <a>WebElement</a> interface. Each instance of this interface represents an
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-dom-20120105/#interface-element">Element</a> as defined in the
  [[!DOM4]] specification. Because the WebDriver API is designed to allow users to interact with apps as if
  they were actual users, the capabilities offered by the
  <code>WebElement</code> interface are somewhat different from those offered by the <a href='http://w3c.github.io/dom/#element'>Document <code>element</code></a> interface.</p>

  <p>Each WebElement instance must have an identifier, which is distinct from the value
  of the <a href='http://w3c.github.io/dom/#element'>Document <code>element</code></a> "id" property. The identifier for every WebElement representing the same
  underlying <a href='http://w3c.github.io/dom/#element'>Document <code>element</code></a> MUST be the same. The identifiers used to refer to different
  underlying <a href='http://w3c.github.io/dom/#element'>Document <code>element</code></a>s MUST be unique within the session over the entire duration of the session.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <p>This requirement around WebElement identifiers allows for efficient equality
    checks when the WebDriver API is being used out of process.</p>
  </div>

  <dl class="idl" title="interface WebElement">
    <dt>readonly attribute DOMString ELEMENT</dt>
    <dd>The WebDriver identifier of this particular element. This SHOULD be a UUID.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>This section of the specification covers finding elements. Later sections deal with querying and interacting with
  these located elements. The primary interface used by the WebDriver API for locating elements is the
  <a>SearchContext</a>.</p>
  <section>

    <p>The primary grouping of <a>WebElement</a> instances is a <code>sequence</code> of <a>WebElement</a> instances</p>

    <p>A reference to an WebElement is obtained via a SearchContext. The key
    interfaces are:</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface Locator">
      <dt>readonly attribute DOMString using</dt>
      <dd>The name of the strategy that should be used to locate elements. The default value is the null value</dd>
      <dt>readonly attribute DOMString value</dt>
      <dd>The value to pass to the element finding strategy. The default value is the null value.</dd>
    </dl>
  </section>
  <section>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface SearchContext">
      <dt>WebElement[] findElements(in Locator locator)</dt>
      <dd></dd>
      <dt>WebElement findElement(in Locator locator)</dt>
      <dd></dd>

    <h2>Element Location Strategies</h2>

    <p>All element location strategies MUST return elements in the order in which they appear in the current document.</p>
    <section>
    <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
      <p>Strategy name: css selector</p>
      <p>If a browser supports the
      <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/selectors-api/">CSS Selectors API</a> ([[!SELECTORS-API]]) it MUST support locating elements by
      CSS Selector. If the browser does not support the browser CSS Selector spec it MAY choose to implement locating
      by this mechanism. If the browser can support locating elements by CSS Selector, it MUST set the "cssSelector" capability to boolean true when responding to the <a href="#creating-a-session">"newSession" command</a>. Elements MUST be returned in the same order as if "<code>querySelectorAll</code>" had been called with the <code>Locator</code>'s <code>value</code>. Compound selectors are allowed.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>ECMAScript</h2>
      <p>Finding elements by ecmascript is covered in the <a href="#ecmascript">ecmascript part of this spec</a>.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Link Text</h2>
      <p>Strategy name: link text</p>
      <p>This strategy MUST be supported by all WebDriver implementations. </p>
      <p>This strategy MUST return all <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element">"a"</a> elements with visible text exactly and case sensitively equal to the term being searched for.</p>
      <div class="note">
	    <p>This is equivalent to:</p>
	    <pre>
		  elements = driver.find_elements(by = By.TAG_NAME, value = "a")
		  result = []
		  for element in elements:
		    text = element.text
		    if text == search_term:
		      result.append(element)
		</pre>
		<p>Where "search_term" is the link text being searched for, and "result" contains the list of elements to return.</p>
	  </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Partial Link Text</h2>
      <p>Strategy name: partial link text</p>
      <p>This strategy MUST be supported by all WebDriver implementations.</p>
      <p>This strategy is very similar to <a href="#link-text">link text</a>, but rather than matching the entire string, only a subset needs to match. That is, this MUST return all <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element">"a"</a> elements with visible text that partially or completely and case sensitively matches the term being searched for.</p>
      <div class="note">
	    <p>This is equivalent to:</p>
	    <pre>
		  elements = driver.find_elements(by = By.TAG_NAME, value = "a")
		  result = []
		  for element in elements:
		    text = element.text
		    if text.search(seach_term) != -1:
		      result.append(element)
		</pre>
		<p>Where "search_term" is the link text being searched for, and "result" contains the list of elements to return.</p>
	  </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>XPath</h2>
      <p>Strategy name: xpath</p>
      <p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support finding elements by XPath 1.0 [[!XPATH]] with the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#interactions-with-xpath-and-xslt">edits from section 3.3</a> of the [[!html51]] specification made. If no native support is present in the browser, a pure JS implementation MAY be used. When called, the returned values MUST be equivalent of calling "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-XPath/xpath.html#XPathEvaluator-evaluate">evaluate</a>" function from [[DOM-LEVEL-3-XPATH]] with the result type set to "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-XPath/xpath.html#XPathResult-ORDERED-NODE-SNAPSHOT-TYPE">ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE</a> (7).</p>
