  <h2>Elements</h2>
  <p class="note">Conformance tests for this section can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/webdriver/">webdriver module</a> under the "element_location" folder.</p>
  <p>One of the key abstractions of the WebDriver API is the 
  <a>WebElement</a> interface. Each instance of this interface represents an 
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-dom-20120105/#interface-element">Element</a> as defined in the
  [[!DOM4]] specification. Because the WebDriver API is designed to allow users to interact with apps as if
  they were actual users, the capabilities offered by the 
  <code>WebElement</code> interface are somewhat different from those offered by the DOM Element interface.</p>

  <p>Each WebElement instance must have an ID, which is distinct from the value
  of the DOM Element's "id" property. The ID for every WebElement representing the same
  underlying DOM Element MUST be the same. The IDs used to refer to different
  underlying DOM Elements MUST be unique within the session over the entire duration of the session.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <p>This requirement around WebElement IDs allows for efficient equality
    checks when the WebDriver API is being used out of process.</p>
  </div>

  <dl class="idl" title="interface WebElement">
    <dt>readonly attribute DOMString id</dt>
    <dd>The WebDriver ID of this particular element. This SHOULD be a UUID.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>This section of the specification covers finding elements. Later sections deal with querying and interacting with
  these located elements. The primary interface used by the WebDriver API for locating elements is the 
  <code>SearchContext</code>.</p>
  <section>
    <h2>Lists of WebElements</h2>
    
    <p>The primary grouping of <a>WebElement</a> instances is an <code>array</code> of <a>WebElement</a> instances</p>
    
    <p>A reference to an WebElement is obtained via a SearchContext. The key
    interfaces are:</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface Locator">
      <dt>readonly attribute DOMString strategy</dt>
      <dd>The name of the strategy that should be used to locate elements. The default value is the null value</dd>
      <dt>readonly attribute DOMString value</dt>
      <dd>The value to pass to the element finding strategy. The default value is the null value.</dd>
    </dl>
  </section>
  <section>
    <dl class="idl" title="interface SeachContext">
      <dt>WebElement[] findElements(in Locator locator)</dt>
      <dd></dd>
      <dt>WebElement findElement(in Locator locator)</dt>
      <dd></dd>

    <h2>Element Location Strategies</h2>

    <p>All element location strategies MUST return elements in the order in which they appear in the current document.</p>
    <section>
    <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
      <table class="simple">
        <tr>
          <th>Capability Name</th>
          <th>Type</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span id="capability-cssSelectors">cssSelectors</span></td>
          <td>boolean</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Strategy name: css selector</p>
      <p>If a browser supports the 
      <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/selectors-api/">CSS Selectors API</a> ([[!SELECTORS-API]]) it MUST support locating elements by
      CSS Selector. If the browser does not support the browser CSS Selector spec it MAY choose to implement locating
      by this mechanism. If the browser can support locating elements by CSS Selector, it MUST set the "cssSelector" capability to boolean true when responding to the <a href="#creating-a-session">"newSession" command</a>. Elements MUST be returned in the same order as if "<code>querySelectorAll</code>" had been called with the <code>Locator</code>'s <code>value</code>. Compound selectors are allowed.</p>

      <h2>ECMAScript</h2>
      <p>Finding elements by ecmascript is covered in the <a href="#ecmascript">ecmascript part of this spec</a>.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Element ID</h2>
      <p>Strategy name: id</p>
      <p>This strategy MUST be supported by all WebDriver implementations.</p>
      <p>The HTML5 specification ([[!HTML5]]) states that <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#the-id-attribute">element
        IDs must be unique within their home subtree</a>. Sadly, this uniqueness
      requirement is not always met. Consequently, this strategy is equally
      valid for finding a single element or groups of elements. In the case of
      finding a single WebElement, this MUST be functionally identical to a call
      to "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-dom-20120105/#dom-document-getelementbyid">document.getElementById()</a>"
      from the Web DOM Core specification ([[!DOM4]]). When finding multiple
      elements, this is equivalent to an CSS query of "<code>#value</code>" where "value" is the ID being searched for with all "'" characters being properly escaped..</p>

      <h2>Link Text</h2>
      <p>Strategy name: link text</p>
      <p>This strategy MUST be supported by all WebDriver implementations. </p>
      <p>This strategy MUST return all <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element">"a"</a> elements with visible text exactly and case sensitively equal to the term being searched for.</p>
      <div class="note">
	    <p>This is equivalent to:</p>
	    <pre>
		  elements = driver.find_elements(by = By.TAG_NAME, value = "a")
		  result = []
		  for element in elements:
		    text = element.text
		    if text == search_term:
		      result.append(element)
		</pre>
		<p>Where "search_term" is the link text being searched for, and "result" contains the list of elements to return.</p>
	  </div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Partial Link Text</h2>
      <p>Strategy name: partial link text</p>
      <p>This strategy MUST be supported by all WebDriver implementations.</p>
      <p>This strategy is very similar to <a href="#link-text">link text</a>, but rather than matching the entire string, only a subset needs to match. That is, this MUST return all <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element">"a"</a> elements with visible text that partially or completely and case sensitively matches the term being searched for.</p>
      <div class="note">
	    <p>This is equivalent to:</p>
	    <pre>
		  elements = driver.find_elements(by = By.TAG_NAME, value = "a")
		  result = []
		  for element in elements:
		    text = element.text
		    if text.search(seach_term) != -1:
		      result.append(element)
		</pre>
		<p>Where "search_term" is the link text being searched for, and "result" contains the list of elements to return.</p>
	  </div>

      <h2>XPath</h2>
      <p>Strategy name: xpath</p>
      <p>All WebDriver implementations MUST support finding elements by XPath 1.0 [[!XPATH]] with the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#interactions-with-xpath-and-xslt">edits from section 3.3</a> of the [[!HTML5]] specification made. If no native support is present in the browser, a pure JS implementation MAY be used. When called, the returned values MUST be equivalent of calling "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-XPath/xpath.html#XPathEvaluator-evaluate">evaluate</a>" function from the DOM Level 3 XPath spec [[DOM-LEVEL-3-XPATH]] with the result type set to "<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-XPath/xpath.html#XPathResult-ORDERED-NODE-SNAPSHOT-TYPE">ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE</a> (7).</p>
